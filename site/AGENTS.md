# netget.net — the landing page

`index.html` is the landing page; `demo.html` is the standalone interactive demo. Only the
demo loads xterm.js and the WebAssembly runtime. Terminal focus belongs to the visitor:
startup, connection, incoming requests, and sending a composer reply must not focus a terminal.

`css/`, `js/`, `favicon.svg`, and `demo/pkg/` — the NetGet-in-the-browser
bundle, which is the one thing here that is built: `./web/build.sh` from the repository root
writes it (gitignored), `web/README.md` explains it, and `./deploy.sh` refuses to run
without it. `./deploy.sh` is the whole publishing pipeline.

`js/demo.js` is the demo page's script and `js/composer.js` the "you are the model" answer
form it opens for each model request (built from the request's offered `actions`; see
`web/README.md`). `composer.js`'s pure half is imported by `web/test/smoke.mjs`, so keep
DOM access out of module top level. `js/thinking.js` splits a thinking model's streamed
`<think>` block from its answer for the LLM panel; it is pure and `smoke.mjs` imports it too.
`js/adventure.js` keeps the Telnet adventure's room for each connection and adds it to every
request, so no model has to remember where the visitor is; `web/test/adventure.mjs` tests it.

What is in this directory is public, with one exception: `deploy.sh` and every `*.md` —
this file included — are excluded from the sync, because this one names infrastructure IDs.
The internal planning documents under `docs/` are not part of the site at all. Adding a
non-markdown file here publishes it, so check before you do.

## Hosting

S3 + CloudFront in AWS account `750984813907` (`AWS_PROFILE=smotana`), the same shape as
the maintainer's other static sites (`zisk.ca`, `ollisten.com`, `matusnomin.com`):

| Piece | Value |
|---|---|
| S3 bucket | `netget.net`, us-east-1, **private** — public access fully blocked, no website config |
| Distribution | `E2LPP647KD7BN2` → `d3m64zfgzk3tzs.cloudfront.net` |
| Aliases | `netget.net`, `*.netget.net` |
| Origin access | OAC `E2IVTMAHEQBL57` (sigv4, always); the bucket policy allows only `cloudfront.amazonaws.com` for this distribution |
| Certificate | ACM us-east-1 `e514d390-7946-4243-8a4d-4e3374aa68de`, DNS-validated, auto-renews |
| Cache policy | Managed-CachingOptimized (`658327ea-…`), compression on |
| Errors | 403 → `/index.html` with status 200 (S3 returns 403, not 404, for a missing key when the OAC has no `ListBucket`) |

The bucket is reachable **only** through CloudFront. A direct
`https://netget.net.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html` returns 403, and that is correct.

## DNS

At **Porkbun** (the registrar is also the nameserver — there is no Route 53 zone for this
domain, and there should not be one):

| Record | Type | Value |
|---|---|---|
| `netget.net` | ALIAS | `d3m64zfgzk3tzs.cloudfront.net` |
| `www.netget.net` | CNAME | `d3m64zfgzk3tzs.cloudfront.net` |
| `_fd521527ba3e64edae0b9e8c783a9628` | CNAME | ACM validation — **do not delete**, the certificate stops renewing without it |

Porkbun's ALIAS flattens at the edge, which is what lets the apex point at CloudFront.

To change DNS from a script: `source ~/bin/porkbun-env`, then POST to
`https://api.porkbun.com/api/json/v3/dns/…` with `apikey` + `secretapikey` in the JSON body.
The apex record's `name` is the empty string, not `@`. The domain must have API access
enabled in the Porkbun panel (Domain Management → netget.net → Details → API ACCESS);
netget.net was not opted in until September 2026.

## What this replaced

GitHub Pages served `docs/` at netget.net via `docs/CNAME`. That stopped being an option
when the repository went private — Pages on a private repository needs a paid plan, and the
site's own links to `github.com/smotanacom/netget` are public-facing links into a private
repository regardless of where the page is hosted.

## Deploying

```bash
./deploy.sh
```

**Caching is by URL.** `css/`, `js/` and `demo/` are published under `v/<hash>/`, where
`<hash>` comes from their contents, with `max-age=31536000, immutable`; both `index.html` and
`demo.html` are rewritten to point at that prefix and go up with `no-cache`. So a browser always loads one
deploy's files together. Publishing them at fixed URLs with a week's `max-age` let a browser pair
a fresh `demo.js` and `netget_web.js` with the previous deploy's `.wasm`, which fails at load
with `wasm.<export> is not a function` — seen on 28 September 2026. Keep new assets inside one of
the versioned directories, or add the directory to `VERSIONED_DIRS`.

Order matters and the script keeps it: versioned assets first, then both HTML pages, then the
invalidation (`/`, `/index.html`, `/demo.html`, `/favicon.svg` — the versioned paths are new, so nothing needs
invalidating there). Old `v/<hash>/` prefixes stay so a page already open keeps loading its
modules; only the newest five are kept. The root sync uses `--delete` with `v/*` excluded, so a
file removed from this directory is removed from the bucket — except an excluded one, which
`--delete` also skips. Deleting `deploy.sh` or a `*.md` from the bucket is a manual
`aws s3 rm`.

`DRY_RUN=1 ./deploy.sh` stages everything and prints what would be uploaded or deleted, changing
nothing; `STAGE_DIR=<dir>` keeps the staged copy — serve it to test the exact layout that ships.

## Third-party scripts carry subresource integrity

`demo.html` loads xterm.js and its fit addon from jsdelivr with `integrity="sha384-…"` and
`crossorigin="anonymous"`: the browser refuses the file unless its hash matches the one
computed from the pinned, immutable version, so a CDN compromise or an interception on the
way fails the load rather than running someone else's script on netget.net (jsdelivr sends
`access-control-allow-origin: *`, which SRI needs). Bumping either version means
recomputing the hash — the comment above the tags has the command. WebLLM is a dynamic
`import()` from esm.run, which rebundles on the CDN, so no hash can describe it; the only
way to pin it is to self-host the bundle under `demo/`, which `deploy.sh` already versions
by content hash. Neither page ships a Content-Security-Policy yet: one would have to allow
`'wasm-unsafe-eval'`, the inline theme script, esm.run, Hugging Face model downloads and
blob workers, and a policy that is wrong breaks the demo silently, so it belongs with a
headless-Chromium run of `web/test/page_composer.py`, not in a text edit.
