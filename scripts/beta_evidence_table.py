"""Generate the Beta-evidence table from the source tree, for servers or for clients.

CLAUDE.md carries a hand-maintained list of which protocols are Beta and what their
evidence is. That list has been wrong three times, in both directions: it under-rated
`etcd` and `modbus` while they already had official-client tests, and it over-rated
`ssh` on the strength of `russh` — which is the server's *own* library, so the "peer"
was the server. A generated table cannot drift.

For every registered protocol on the selected side this prints:

  state          the DevelopmentState its own metadata() declares
  peer           the third-party binaries and crates its tests actually drive
  circular       any of those crates that its own src/<side>/<p>/ also imports, which
                 means the peer is the same implementation as the framer and the
                 evidence proves only that a crate agrees with itself
  optional       any of those crates declared `optional = true` in Cargo.toml, which
                 means the dependency is not compiled where the gate runs
  ignored        how many of its tests are #[ignore]d
  skip-gate      whether a test prints a skip message and returns success anyway

The last four are the three ways CLAUDE.md says evidence fails to execute, plus the
circular case. `--check` exits non-zero only on what a script can be *sure* of.
Circular and optional dependencies are printed as review flags instead, because both
have accepted exceptions (`quic`/quinn and `webrtc`/webrtc-rs use the server's own
crate in the opposite role, completing a real handshake) and no static rule can tell
those from the `ssh`/russh case.

THE TWO BARS ARE NOT THE SAME, which is why `--side` is more than a path swap.

A **server** proves itself against a third-party *client*. A **client** proves itself
against a third-party *server* — and CLAUDE.md's client bar adds two conditions the
server bar does not have:

  * **The peer must not be NetGet's own server.** Pointing NetGet's redis client at
    NetGet's redis server proves the two agree, which is what they were both written to
    do. This is the circular case wearing the other hat, and it is by far the largest
    group: the September 2026 hand audit put it at ~60 of 98. It is detected here as
    `self-served` — a test that builds a `ServerForm`, calls `start_netget_server` or
    sends an `open_server` action — and it is blocking when nothing else backs the
    rating up.
  * **`#[ignore]` disqualifies, not just a skip gate.** The server bar treats a partly
    ignored suite as a review flag, because a suite may legitimately ignore its
    adapter-claiming tests while its real evidence runs. The client bar does not: the
    audit's second-largest group was "real peer, unreachable evidence — and every one
    of those tests is `#[ignore]`d". So peers are attributed **per file**, and a peer
    that appears only in files where every test is ignored is reported as unreachable
    and fails `--check` on the client side.

What this cannot check, on either side, is the fourth client condition — that the
client acts on the model's answer, asserted on the wire. `tests/client_event_wiring_test.rs`
is the ratchet for that; this script names it as a review item rather than pretending
to decide it, because "the LLM was called" and "the client did what it said" look
identical to a scan.

    python3 scripts/beta_evidence_table.py                      # Beta servers, markdown
