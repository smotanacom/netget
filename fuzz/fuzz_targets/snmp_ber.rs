//! `netget::server::snmp` — the BER depth guard and the `rasn` decoder it guards.
//!
//! This is the same shape as the bencode target and for the same reason: `check_ber_structure`
//! exists because BER is recursive by construction and `rasn` counts nothing, so one
//! unauthenticated UDP datagram of nested constructed tags would otherwise recurse until the
//! guard page. `SnmpServer::parse_snmp_message` runs the guard and then `rasn::ber::decode`
//! in sequence, which is exactly the pair whose contract matters:
//!
//! **anything the guard accepts, the decoder must survive.**
//!
//! Fuzzing the guard alone would prove only that the guard does not crash — which is the
//! easy half, and not the half that killed the process.
