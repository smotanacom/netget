//! DNS wire format — `hickory_proto::op::Message::from_vec`.
//!
//! **NetGet has no DNS parser of its own.** `src/server/dns/mod.rs`, `dot/mod.rs` and
//! `doh/mod.rs` each call `DnsMessage::from_vec(&data)` inline in their receive loop and
//! hand the result to the model; there is no hand-written framing or name decompression
//! anywhere around it. That makes this the one target here that fuzzes a third-party crate
//! rather than NetGet code — and it earns its place anyway, because the exposure is NetGet's:
//! three registered protocols reach this decoder from an unauthenticated datagram on the
//! first packet, and a crash inside it kills the whole process exactly as one inside our own
//! code would.
//!
//! Name compression is the reason to fuzz it: a compression pointer may point backwards into
//! the message, and a decoder that follows pointers without bounding the chain either loops
//! or recurses. That is the same class as the six overflows this harness exists for, sitting
//! in a dependency rather than in `src/`.
//!
//! If this target crashes, the finding belongs upstream — and the NetGet-side fix is a
//! structural screen in front of `from_vec`, the shape `utils::bencode` already establishes.
