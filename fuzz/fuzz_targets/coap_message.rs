//! `netget::server::coap::codec::CoapMessage::decode` — RFC 7252 over an unauthenticated
//! UDP socket. Hand-rolled on purpose, so there is no third-party decoder underneath it.
//!
//! The option walker is the interesting part: CoAP option deltas and lengths use 13/14
//! extension encodings, and the accumulated delta is what turns into an option number. This
//! target also round-trips whatever decodes, because `encode` is the direction `m3ua` proved
//! can carry a bound the decoder has and the encoder does not.

    // `encode` returns a `Result` — it refuses an over-long token or option value rather than
    // narrowing it to fit — and **that is what broke this target**: it was written when
    // `encode` returned a bare `Vec<u8>`, `0996d00f` made it fallible hours later, and
    // `CoapMessage::decode(&reencoded)` has been an E0308 ever since. Nothing noticed, because
    // `fuzz/` is its own workspace that `cargo check` at the repository root never compiles,
    // and no CI job builds it. A fuzz target that does not compile has not run, so CoAP's
    // "a fuzz target exists and has run clean" was false from September 15 2026 until it was
    // rebuilt in this pass.
    //
    // `expect` rather than a silent `let Ok(..) else`: neither refusal is *reachable* from a
    // decoded message — `decode` bounds tkl at 8 and an option length at u16::MAX, which are
    // exactly the two bounds `encode` checks — so an `Err` here is a real disagreement between
    // the two directions and belongs in a crash artefact rather than in an early return.
