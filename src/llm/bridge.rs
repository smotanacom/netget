//! An LLM backend that asks the host to answer.
//!
//! The browser build has no HTTP client it could point at Ollama and no model of its own;
//! what it has is a page. The page may run a model in-browser (the browser's built-in model,
//! or WebLLM over WebGPU), or show the request to the person at the keyboard and let *them*
//! be the model. NetGet does not need to know which: every request
//! `OllamaClient` would have sent over HTTP becomes a [`BridgeRequest`] on a channel, and
//! whoever drains the channel answers it with a [`BridgeReply`].
//!
//! The request carries everything the wire request would have: the model name, the full
//! message list (system prompt included) and the tool schemas. That is deliberate: the demo
//! page shows all of it, so a visitor sees exactly what NetGet says to a model and what comes
//! back. Nothing here is browser-specific; a native test can drain the same channel, which is
//! how the mapping from request to `ChatResponse` is verified.
//!
//! It also carries what no wire request does: the actions the prompt offers, as structured
//! data ([`BridgeRequest::actions`]). A network event's request has no native tool schemas —
//! the action list is prose inside the prompt — and a person answering by hand needs the
//! names, the parameters and a working example in a form a page can turn into a form.
