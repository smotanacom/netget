/// `.with_no_actions()`, which this ignores.
///
/// Returns one human-readable finding per offending event; empty means the protocol is clean.
///
/// # The hole this used to have
///
/// It early-returned when `get_sync_actions()` was empty, on the reasoning that "a protocol
/// with nothing to advertise is not withholding anything". That reasoning is backwards, and it
/// made the guard **pass hardest on the most broken protocol in the tree**: `usb-fido2`
/// declared zero sync actions *and* three events with no actions, so it could not answer any
/// event at all, and the audit waved it through with `0 findings`. A protocol that offers the
/// model nothing is the worst case, not the exempt case.
///
/// The one legitimate shape is **delegation**: `doh` and `dot` return `DnsProtocol`'s sync
/// actions from their own `get_sync_actions()` and attach them to their events, so they are
/// non-empty on both counts and never reach this branch. Delegation that forwards another
/// protocol's actions is therefore already covered — what is flagged is an event with an
/// empty, non-intentional action list, whether or not the protocol declares sync actions of
/// its own. The deliberate case is still `EventType::with_no_actions()`.
///
/// # Where this belongs
///
/// Call it **once per protocol at server-startup time** — `src/cli/server_startup.rs`, after
/// the protocol object is resolved from the registry and before `spawn()` — so a
/// misdeclared event is reported against a named server the user just tried to start, and
/// the failure is attributable. The equivalent check must not live on the per-event path:
/// that runs once per connection inside a tokio task, where a `debug_assert!` panic is
/// swallowed by the task and leaves the server still reporting `Running`.
///
/// `tests/event_action_declarations_test.rs` runs this over the whole registry, which
/// catches the defect in CI for every protocol rather than only for the ones a run happens
/// to start — though only for the features that run happens to compile in, which is why the
/// test also asserts a lower bound on how many protocols it inspected.
