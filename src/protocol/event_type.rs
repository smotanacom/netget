SCRIPT TEMPLATE for this protocol:
When creating a script, structure it with a switch/case on the event type:

Python example:
import json, sys
data = json.load(sys.stdin)
event_type = data['event_type_id']

if event_type == "event_id_1":
    # Handle this event type
    result = {{"actions": [{{"type": "action_name", "param": value}}]}}
elif event_type == "event_id_2":
    # Handle another event type
    result = {{"actions": [{{"type": "other_action", "param": value}}]}}
else:
    # Unknown event - fallback to LLM
    result = {{"fallback_to_llm": true, "fallback_reason": "Unknown event type"}}

print(json.dumps(result))

JavaScript example:
const data = JSON.parse(require('fs').readFileSync(0, 'utf-8'));
const eventType = data.event_type_id;
let result;

switch (eventType) {{
  case "event_id_1":
    result = {{"actions": [{{"type": "action_name", "param": value}}]}};
    break;
  case "event_id_2":
    result = {{"actions": [{{"type": "other_action", "param": value}}]}};
    break;
  default:
    result = {{"fallback_to_llm": true, "fallback_reason": "Unknown event type"}};
}}

console.log(JSON.stringify(result));
