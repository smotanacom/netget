/// far more than that needs. Every word of that is true and none of it is about the peer this

/// other end will answer it.
///
/// The question a first-byte bound actually has to answer is whether NetGet's own client of
/// this protocol can be connected and silent. FTP's can, and is, by default:
/// `src/client/ftp/mod.rs` opens the socket, splits it, registers the command channel, raises
/// `ftp_connected`, and then reads the `220` in its read loop. It writes nothing of its own —
/// every byte it puts on the wire comes from an action, and a client created from the
/// dashboard's `[ + ftp client ]` is routed `ftp_connected` → static-with-no-actions and then
/// `*` → manual (`src/tui/modal/form.rs`). So it connects, is answered with nothing, reads our
/// greeting, parks that too, and waits for a person to type into `[ send message ]`. At 60
/// seconds this server hung up on the operator's own client while they were still looking at
/// it.
///
/// 300 seconds is the window a `manual` rule gives a human to answer one event
/// (`src/state/intercepts.rs`), which is the number this product already uses for how long
/// someone might take.
///
/// What it costs: a stranger holding a socket, a task, an `AppState` row and one of
/// [`MAX_CONNECTIONS`] slots while saying nothing now gets 300 seconds rather than 60. That is
/// a fivefold rise in how long one idle slot is held, not a removal of the bound — the cap
/// still holds and a peer over it is still answered [`CONNECTION_CAP_REFUSAL`]. A listener
/// genuinely exposed to strangers should set `first_byte_timeout_secs` low; 60 is the old
/// value and remains a sound choice for one.
///
/// The greeting itself is generated and written before the command loop begins, so the model's
