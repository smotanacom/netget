/// HTTP is client-speaks-first: the server says nothing until a request line arrives, so a peer
/// that has completed the TCP handshake and sent no byte has asked nothing and negotiated
/// nothing. That state carries no protocol yet, which is why this number is the same across
/// netget's HTTP-shaped servers while the idle bound below is not. Apache's `mod_reqtimeout`
/// gives the request header 20s and nginx's `client_header_timeout` 60s; 30s sits between the
/// two deployed norms.
///
/// hyper's own `header_read_timeout` is **not** this bound: its 30-second default is inert
/// unless `http1::Builder::timer` is also set, which nothing here does — hyper downgrades a
/// defaulted duration to `None` when no timer is present and applies no deadline at all.

/// it needs no further argument: a netget HTTP server's clients are whatever the operator points
/// at it — a browser, `curl`, a generated SDK — so the number the deployed web is already tuned
/// against is the right one. Apache's `KeepAliveTimeout` of 5s is the other end of the range and
/// is tuned for a front-end serving far more connections than this one admits.
///
/// A request still being answered is not silence: the watchdog reads
/// [`ConnectionActivity`](crate::server::accept_bounded::ConnectionActivity), which reports a
/// connection with work in flight — a model round-trip, or an event a `manual` rule parked for a
/// human at the dashboard (`src/state/intercepts.rs`, 300s by default) — as not idle at all. So
/// an answer that takes longer than this bound can never close the connection it is an answer

///   still serving traffic, and every later stat update and the eventual
///   `close_connection_on_server` silently target a connection that is gone.
/// - Connection-scoped scheduled tasks put these counters and the idle time
///   straight into the model's prompt (`src/llm/prompt.rs`), which is what an
///   idle-timeout or rate-limiting instruction is supposed to reason about.
