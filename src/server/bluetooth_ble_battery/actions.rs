//! BLE Battery Service (0x180F) - report battery level as a percentage
//!
//! Profile wrapper over the `bluetooth-ble` base stack.
//!
//! The base server (`BluetoothBle::spawn_with_llm_actions`) hardcodes `BluetoothBleProtocol`
//! when it calls `call_llm`, so the events the model actually sees and the actions it may
//! answer with are always the base's. Declaring profile-specific actions or events here would
//! document a vocabulary that no code path can ever emit or execute, so this protocol forwards
//! the base's set verbatim - the same shape `doh`/`dot` use to forward `DnsProtocol`'s actions.
//! The profile identity lives in the instruction preamble and in the GATT layout suggested by
//! the startup examples below.
