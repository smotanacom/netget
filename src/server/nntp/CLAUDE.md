# NNTP Protocol Implementation

## Overview

NNTP (Network News Transfer Protocol) server implementing Usenet news server functionality. The LLM controls news
article distribution, newsgroup management, and article retrieval. Focuses on core NNTP commands (LIST, GROUP, ARTICLE,
POST, etc.) with line-based text protocol.

**Status**: Experimental (Application Protocol)
**RFC**: RFC 3977 (Network News Transfer Protocol), RFC 2980 (Common NNTP Extensions)
**Port**: 119 (plain TCP), 563 (with TLS, not implemented)

## Library Choices

- **No NNTP library** - Manual protocol implementation
    - NNTP is line-based text protocol (simple parsing)
    - Commands parsed from text lines
    - Responses constructed as formatted strings with numeric codes
    - Multi-line responses end with ".\r\n"
- **tokio** - Async runtime and I/O
    - `TcpListener` for accepting connections
    - `BufReader` for line-based reading
    - `AsyncWriteExt` for sending responses

**Rationale**: NNTP protocol is straightforward enough that no dedicated library is needed. Messages are text lines
ending with `\r\n`, commands are space-separated tokens, responses use numeric codes (similar to SMTP/FTP). Manual
implementation gives LLM full control over newsgroup and article management.

## Architecture Decisions

### 1. Action-Based LLM Control

The LLM receives NNTP commands and responds with structured actions:

- `send_nntp_message` - Send raw NNTP message
- `send_nntp_response` - Send response with code and text (e.g., "200 Service ready")
- `send_nntp_article` - Send article with headers and body (multi-line)
- `send_nntp_list` - Send list of newsgroups (multi-line)
- `send_nntp_group` - Send GROUP response (211 count low high group)
- `send_nntp_overview` - Send article overview (XOVER/OVER command)
- `wait_for_more` - Buffer more data before responding
- `close_connection` - Close client connection

### 2. Line-Based Message Processing

NNTP message flow:

1. Accept TCP connection
2. Send greeting (200 Service ready or 201 No posting)
3. Read lines with `BufReader::read_line()` (splits on `\n`)
4. Parse NNTP command from line (e.g., "GROUP comp.lang.rust\r\n")
5. Send line to LLM as `nntp_command_received` event
6. LLM returns actions (e.g., `send_nntp_group`)
7. Execute actions (send responses)
8. Loop for next line

### 3. Automatic Line Termination

All NNTP messages must end with `\r\n`:

- Received messages: Preserved as-is from `read_line()`
- Sent messages: Automatically add `\r\n` if not present
- `send_nntp_message`: Formats to ensure `\r\n` termination
- Multi-line responses: End with `.\r\n` (dot-stuffing for lines starting with dot)

### 4. Multi-Line Responses

NNTP uses multi-line responses for articles, lists, etc.:

- Start with status line (e.g., "220 <msg-id> article follows")
- Content lines
- End with `.\r\n` on its own line
- Lines starting with `.` should be dot-stuffed (`.` → `..`)

### 5. Dual Logging

- **DEBUG**: Command summary with 100-char preview ("NNTP received 15 bytes: GROUP comp.lang.rust")
- **TRACE**: Full text message ("NNTP data (text): \"GROUP comp.lang.rust\\r\\n\"")
- Both go to netget.log and TUI Status panel

### 6. Connection Management

Each NNTP client gets:

- Unique `ConnectionId`
- Entry in `ServerInstance.connections` with `ProtocolConnectionInfo::Nntp`
- Tracked bytes sent/received, packets sent/received
- State: Active until client disconnects or sends QUIT

## LLM Integration

## Connection Management

### Connection Lifecycle

1. **Accept**: TCP listener accepts connection
2. **Register**: Connection added to `ServerInstance` with `ProtocolConnectionInfo::Nntp`
3. **Split**: Stream split into ReadHalf and WriteHalf
4. **Track**: WriteHalf stored in `Arc<Mutex<WriteHalf>>` for sending
5. **Greeting**: Send initial greeting (200 or 201)
6. **Read Loop**: Continuous line reading until disconnect
7. **Close**: Connection removed when client closes or sends QUIT

### Dashboard injection (`[ message this peer ]` / `[ disconnect this peer ]`)

`handle_connection` registers a peer handle (`server::peer_support`) right after the connection
is tracked and *before* the greeting event, so a manual `*` rule parking the greeting still
leaves the operator able to reach the connection. `AppState::send_to_peer` runs the action
through the same executor as the LLM path; every wire verb here returns `ActionResult::Output`
and `close_connection` half-closes, so there is no `Custom` gap. Every read and every write the
server itself makes goes through `update_connection_stats` (injected writes are counted by the
generic peer task, not here), and the handle is removed on every exit path (EOF, read error,
`close_connection`, refused greeting, overload 400) by the single cleanup in
`handle_connection`. Test: `tests/server/nntp/peer_inject_test.rs` (zero LLM calls).

### State Management

- `ProtocolState`: Idle/Processing/Accumulating (prevents concurrent LLM calls)
- `queued_data`: Data buffered while LLM is processing
- Connection stays in ServerInstance until closed
- UI updates on every message (bytes sent/received, last activity)

## Failure contract: the peer always gets a line, and it is always a category

NNTP is strictly one response line per command and the server speaks first, so silence is not a
neutral outcome here - the client blocks on a line that is never coming, and if it gives up and
sends the next command it reads that command's reply as this one's. Every path in `run_session`
that produces nothing to send therefore writes a 4xx instead:

| Situation | Greeting | Command | Log tag |
|---|---|---|---|
| LLM backend overloaded | `400`, then close | `400`, then close (RFC 3977 3.1: come back later) | `decision=fail_closed_llm_error` |
| LLM call errored otherwise | `400`, then close | `403`, session stays open | `decision=fail_closed_llm_error` |
| An action failed to execute | `400`, then close | `403`, session stays open | `decision=fail_closed_action_error` |
| The answer contained no actions | `400`, then close | `403`, session stays open | `decision=fail_closed_no_actions` |
| `wait_for_more` / `close_connection` | nothing written (deliberate) | nothing written (deliberate) | - |
| The model answered | its own line | its own line | `decision=model_answer` / `model_reject` |

Two rules hold across all of it:

- **The peer gets a category, the log gets the error.** The free text comes from
  `crate::utils::WireFailure` (`&'static str`), never from the error, the action name, the
  backend URL or the model name. A newline in an error could otherwise forge a second response
  line and desynchronise the session on its own. `tests/wire_failure_test.rs` fails the build if
  an interpolated form reappears.
- **An answer with no actions is the worse case, not the exempt one.** It is what an empty model
  reply, a manual "answer with nothing" and a zero-action static handler all produce, and it
  arrives as `Ok` with no failures - which is exactly why it used to slip through. Only an
  explicit `wait_for_more` or `close_connection` buys silence.

`model_reject` (a 4xx/5xx line the model itself chose) is kept distinct in the log from
netget's own `fail_closed_*` replies, so a real denial is never confused with a backend outage.

Tests: `tests/server/nntp/llm_failure_test.rs` covers all four failure rows.

## Known Limitations

### 1. No Article Storage

- Server doesn't store articles persistently
- No database or filesystem storage
- LLM generates articles on-demand from prompts
- No real article retention or expiry

**Workaround**: LLM can maintain pseudo-storage through conversation context or external database via actions.

### 2. No Authentication

- No AUTHINFO USER/PASS support
- No SASL authentication (RFC 4643)
- All users treated as anonymous

**Future Enhancement**: Add AUTHINFO commands and authentication actions.

### 3. No Posting Support (Yet)

- No POST command handling
- Read-only news server
- Clients can retrieve but not post articles

**Future Enhancement**: Add POST action and article submission handling.

### 4. No Feed Management

- No peer-to-peer article distribution
- No IHAVE/CHECK/TAKETHIS commands
- Single-server only

### 5. No TLS Support

- Plain TCP only (port 119)
- No SSL/TLS encryption (port 563)

**Workaround**: Use reverse proxy (e.g., nginx) for TLS termination.

### 6. Limited NNTP Extensions

- No XPAT (pattern matching)
- No LISTGROUP (list article numbers)
- No HDR (header retrieval)
- Basic NNTP commands only

**Future Enhancement**: Add common NNTP extensions as needed.

### 7. No Newsgroup Hierarchy Management

- No dynamic newsgroup creation/deletion
- Newsgroups defined in LLM prompt
- No newsgroups file

## Example Prompts

### Basic Read-Only News Server

```
listen on port 119 via nntp
Send greeting: "200 NetGet NNTP Service Ready - posting allowed"
Support newsgroups: comp.lang.rust, comp.lang.python, misc.test
When users send LIST, show all newsgroups
When users send GROUP <name>, respond with article count
When users send ARTICLE <number>, generate a test article
When users send QUIT, close connection
```

### News Server with Categories

```
listen on port 119 via nntp
Newsgroups: comp.lang.rust, comp.lang.python, sci.math, rec.arts.books
For GROUP command, show: comp.lang.rust has 50 articles (1-50)
For ARTICLE command, generate relevant article based on newsgroup
For XOVER command, show article summaries with subject, author, date
```

### Tech News Server

```
listen on port 119 via nntp
Act as a tech news aggregator
Newsgroups: tech.programming, tech.linux, tech.security
Generate articles about recent tech topics
Each article has proper headers (Subject, From, Date, Message-ID)
Support ARTICLE, HEAD, BODY commands
```

### Simple Test Server

```
listen on port 119 via nntp
One newsgroup: misc.test
10 test articles (numbers 1-10)
All articles say "This is test article <number>"
Support LIST, GROUP, ARTICLE commands
```

## Performance Characteristics

### Latency

- **Per Command (with scripting)**: Sub-millisecond
- **Per Command (without scripting)**: 2-5 seconds (LLM call)
- Line parsing: <1 microsecond
- Response formatting: <1 microsecond

### Throughput

- **With Scripting**: Thousands of commands per second
- **Without Scripting**: ~0.2-0.5 commands per second (LLM-limited)
- Concurrent connections: Unlimited (bounded by system resources)
- Each connection processes independently

### Scripting Compatibility

Good scripting candidate:

- Text-based protocol (easy to parse and generate)
- Repetitive command/response patterns
- Article content can be templated
- Newsgroup lists are static
