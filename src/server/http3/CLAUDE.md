# HTTP/3 server

Feature `http3` registers HTTP3 client and server separately from raw QUIC.
Default UDP/443, ALPN exactly `h3`, TLS 1.3, RFC 9114 HEADERS/DATA/control/QPACK
framing implemented by h3 0.0.8 and h3-quinn 0.0.10 over quinn 0.11/rustls 0.23.
This is a native feature; browser feature sets do not enable it.

`http3_request_received` carries method, path with query, header object (repeated
values use arrays), UTF-8 body, trailer object, stream index and peer address.
`send_http3_response` supplies final status 200..599, headers, UTF-8 body and
trailers. `cancel_http3_request` resets this request, without closing unrelated
streams. HEAD suppresses the response body; 204/205/304 require an empty body.
No filesystem, database, routes or response store is implemented in the protocol.
Static handlers, scripts, manual decisions and model actions supply responses.

Both PEM `cert_path` and `key_path` must be supplied together, or a localhost
certificate is generated. Clients must explicitly trust self-signed certificates.
Bounds: 32 KiB decoded header/trailer field sections including pseudo-fields, 8 MiB UTF-8 bodies,
64 connections including pending TLS (max_connections 1..256), 32 concurrent
requests per connection (max_streams 1..32), 10-second handshake (1..60),
30-second whole request/handler/write deadline (1..300), 300-second QUIC idle
(1..3600). Receive credit is bounded. Migration and 0-RTT are disabled.

The registered endpoint task owns connection futures; each owns request futures.
The HTTP/3 connection accept/control path remains polled while RequestResolvers,
body reads and handlers are pending. Over-capacity incoming connections are
refused. Removal drops every owned request and closes the endpoint, including
pending reads or handlers. Stream guards reset unfinished responses and stop
receives on timeout/cancellation. No detached task retains a socket.

A failed handler produces generic 503; no usable response or invalid individual action produces
500. Multiple final responses reset the request. Decision tags distinguish model_answer/model_reject/model_silent from
fail_closed_llm_error (with shared WireFailure category), action/request failures
and timeout. Optional GREASE frames are disabled for tested aioquic interoperability. Internal
errors stay in logs. Malformed/oversize bodies and aborted exchanges reset their
request streams. h3 enforces HTTP/3 frame and field section validation. Connection
counters count semantic message bodies, not encrypted UDP datagrams.

Experimental: independent pinned aioquic 1.3.0 coverage exists in both directions,
plus NetGet pairing and lifecycle/bounds tests. No second independent HTTP/3
implementation, pcap oracle or fuzz target is claimed. No server push, HTTP
DATAGRAM, WebTransport, 0-RTT, migration, binary-body action or priority scheduler.
Client urgency is passed as an ordinary `priority` header for handlers to inspect.

The local h3-quinn pending-read cancellation patch retains original MIT licensing
and upstream provenance. See vendor/h3-quinn/README.netget.md and
`tests/http3_cancellation_test.rs` (failed upstream, passes patched).
