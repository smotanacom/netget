# Socket.IO server — Experimental, Socket.IO protocol v5 over Engine.IO v4

hyper HTTP/1.1 at `path` (default `/socket.io/`). `packet.rs` (shared with the client) holds
both codecs: Engine.IO packets (open, close, ping, pong, message, upgrade, noop; payloads split
on the record separator U+001E; binary refused) and Socket.IO packets
(`<type>[<nsp>,][<id>][<json>]`; binary event/ack refused; namespaces `/[A-Za-z0-9/._-]`).

Engine.IO, all in Rust:
- `EIO` must be 4 (else 400 `{"code":5}`); unknown transport code 0, unknown sid code 1, bad
  request code 3. 256 sessions; each is registered as a connection with a peer handle.
- Long-polling: the first GET opens a session (`0{"sid","upgrades":["websocket"],"pingInterval",
  "pingTimeout","maxPayload":1000000}`); a GET waits for queued packets (a ping comes within
  pingInterval) and returns them record-separated; a second GET at the same time closes the
  session; POST bodies are packet lists, answered `ok`.
- WebSocket: direct (`transport=websocket` without sid → open packet as the first frame) or by
  upgrade (`2probe` → `3probe`, a noop flushes the pending poll, then `5`), on the same
  connection task after hyper's upgrade.
- Heartbeat: the server pings every `ping_interval_ms` (25000); no pong within
  `ping_timeout_ms` (20000) closes the session (reason `ping timeout`). 256 packets queue per
  session; overflow closes it.

Socket.IO: a CONNECT to a namespace outside `namespaces` (default `/`) gets CONNECT_ERROR
`Invalid namespace` from Rust; otherwise `socketio_connect` asks the handler — `socketio_accept`
(Rust assigns the socket id, answers `0{"sid"}`, then runs any emits/joins in the same answer)
or `socketio_reject` (CONNECT_ERROR with its message); silence or a failure is CONNECT_ERROR
with a category message, never an accept. `socketio_event` carries name, arguments, whether an
ack is awaited and the socket's rooms; answers are `socketio_emit` (to sender, namespace,
`room:<r>` or `socket:<id>`, optionally excluding the sender, optionally asking the single
recipient for an ack whose answer raises `socketio_ack_received`), `socketio_ack` (sent once,
only when the client awaits one), `socketio_join`/`socketio_leave` (64 rooms per socket),
`socketio_disconnect_socket`. Leaving sockets raise `socketio_disconnect` with the reason. Peer
actions: `socketio_emit` to the session's socket in a namespace, `socketio_disconnect_socket`,
`disconnect` (the whole session).

Not implemented: binary attachments, CORS headers, Engine.IO v3 / Socket.IO v4 protocol
revisions, multi-process adapters, connection state recovery.
