# NTP Protocol Implementation

## Overview

NTP (Network Time Protocol) server implementing RFC 5905 for time synchronization.

### Default behaviour: static, no LLM

A normal time response is **mechanical** — stratum 2, LOCL reference id, current-time timestamps,
with the origin timestamp and version echoed from the request — so **by default the server answers
statically with no LLM round-trip.** The model is consulted only when the operator **opts in**: a
non-empty server instruction, or a per-event handler configured for the request event (gated by
`should_call_llm` in `mod.rs` = `has_instruction || has_handler`). Opt-in is how you make the
server skew or lie about the time. Even in opt-in mode, if the LLM call fails the server **falls
back to the correct static time response** (`send_static_time_response` in `mod.rs`). The
`Action-Based LLM Control` and `LLM Integration` material below describes that opt-in path; it is
not invoked on the default path.

**Status**: Beta (Core Protocol)
**RFC**: RFC 5905 (NTPv4), RFC 1305 (NTPv3)
**Port**: 123 (UDP)
**Privilege**: declares `PrivilegeRequirement::PrivilegedPort(123)`; any port above 1023 needs none.
**Test coverage**: `tests/server/ntp/test.rs` (note the file is `test.rs`, not `e2e_test.rs`).
`rsntp` must **succeed** — it validates the origin-timestamp echo, the mode and the leap
indicator, which are the three things a real client rejects a reply over — and the raw 48-byte
path decodes every field by hand against RFC 5905.

This paragraph used to say the raw path "only prints its outcome and never asserts, so the suite
passes even if the client rejects every reply", and to call the whole file a smoke test. That was
true of the old body, where `rsntp` failing was caught and printed as "this may be expected if
LLM doesn't respond" — a timeout, an I/O error and a rejected packet were indistinguishable from
a pass. It is not true now, and the description outlived the code by long enough to be worth
naming: **a "treat this as a smoke test" note is exactly the claim to re-derive**, because it
tells the next person not to trust coverage that may since have become real.

## Library Choices

- **Manual NTP packet construction** - No external library
    - NTP protocol is simple enough to implement directly
    - 48-byte fixed-size packet structure
    - Minimal parsing required (just extract client's transmit timestamp)
    - Custom `build_ntp_packet()` function constructs responses

**Rationale**: Unlike DNS/DHCP, NTP packet structure is very simple (fixed 48 bytes, mostly timestamps). Using a library
would add unnecessary dependency. Manual implementation provides full control and is easier to understand.

**Note**: ntpd-rs exists but is a full NTP daemon implementation, not a simple protocol library.

## Architecture Decisions

### 1. Action-Based LLM Control

The LLM responds with a single action:

- `send_ntp_time_response` - Send time synchronization response
- `send_ntp_response` - Send raw hex packet (advanced)
- `ignore_request` - No response

The `send_ntp_time_response` action has many optional parameters (stratum, precision, timestamps), all with sensible
defaults. LLM typically only needs to specify stratum level.

### 2. Automatic Origin Timestamp Echo

NTP requires the server to echo the client's transmit timestamp as the origin timestamp:

1. Client sends a request with transmit_timestamp = T1
2. The reply must carry T1 verbatim in bytes 24-31
3. The client matches the reply to its request by that value and uses it for round-trip delay —
   `rsntp`, `chrony` and `ntpdate` all discard a reply whose origin timestamp is anything else,
   which surfaces as a timeout rather than an error

**Implementation**: the socket loop reads bytes 40-47 of the request and builds a per-request
`NtpProtocol::for_request(origin, version)` handler. `send_ntp_time_response` writes that value into
the reply unless the action explicitly overrides `origin_timestamp`. Because the handler instance
belongs to one datagram, concurrent requests cannot pick up each other's timestamps.

Two things this deliberately does *not* do:

- It does not fall back to the current time when the request carried no usable timestamp (a request
  shorter than 48 bytes). Those bytes stay zero — a visible mismatch beats a fabricated one.
- It does not modify the action list after `call_llm` returns. An earlier version tried to inject
  `origin_timestamp` into `execution_result.raw_actions` after the call, but `call_llm` has already
  executed the actions and built the packet by then, so that code never affected a single byte on
  the wire and the origin timestamp was always zero-or-now. Any similar post-hoc mutation of
  `raw_actions` is dead code.

### 2b. Version Echo

RFC 5905 says a server answers in the version the client used. Byte 0's version field is copied from
the request (clamped to 1-4, default 4), so an NTPv3 client gets a v3 reply. Mode is always 4
(server).

### 3. Flexible Timestamp Format

Timestamps can be provided as:

- `"current_time"` - Use system's current time (most common)
- Unix timestamp (seconds since 1970) - Converted to NTP format
- Raw NTP timestamp (64-bit: seconds + fraction) - Used as-is
- `null` or omitted - Defaults to current_time

**NTP Epoch**: NTP uses January 1, 1900 as epoch (2,208,988,800 seconds before Unix epoch)

### 4. Sensible Defaults

LLM doesn't need to understand NTP packet structure. Default values:

- `leap_indicator`: 0 (no warning)
- `stratum`: 2 (secondary time source)
- `poll`: 6 (64-second polling interval)
- `precision`: -20 (~1 microsecond)
- `root_delay`: 0.0 (no delay)
- `root_dispersion`: 0.0 (no error)
- `reference_id`: "" (empty)
- All timestamps: current_time

LLM can override any field if instructed (e.g., "act as stratum 1 server").

### 5. Dual Logging

- **DEBUG**: Request summary ("NTP received 48 bytes from 127.0.0.1")
- **TRACE**: Full hex dump of NTP packets (both request and response)
- Both go to netget.log and TUI Status panel

### 6. Connection Tracking

Each NTP request creates a "connection" entry:

- Connection ID: unique per request
- Protocol info: `ProtocolConnectionInfo::empty()` — no NTP-specific payload is attached
- Records the peer address, byte and packet counts
- Status: Active. Entries are never reaped, so a busy server accumulates one per request

## LLM Integration

### Event Type

**`ntp_request`** - Triggered when NTP client sends time request

Event parameters:

- `current_time` (number) - server's current time as a Unix timestamp
- `client_transmit_timestamp` (number, optional) - the client's transmit time as the **raw 64-bit
  NTP value**; absent when the request was shorter than 48 bytes
- `client_transmit_unix` (number, optional) - the same value in whole Unix seconds, lossy, for
  readability only
- `client_version` (number) - NTP version of the request, echoed in the reply
- `client_mode` (number) - mode field of the request (3 = normal client query)
- `bytes_received` (number) - size of the received datagram; > 48 means extension fields or an
  authentication MAC, which are ignored

### Available Actions

#### `send_ntp_time_response`

Send NTP time synchronization response. Most fields have sensible defaults.

Parameters (all optional except where noted):

- `leap_indicator` - Leap second warning: 0=none, 1=+1s, 2=-1s, 3=unsync (default: 0)
- `stratum` - Stratum level: 0=unspec, 1=primary, 2-15=secondary (default: 2)
- `poll` - Poll interval as log2(seconds): 4=16s, 6=64s, 10=1024s (default: 6)
- `precision` - Clock precision as log2(seconds), negative values (default: -20)
- `root_delay` - Round-trip delay to primary reference in seconds (default: 0.0)
- `root_dispersion` - Max error relative to primary reference in seconds (default: 0.0)
- `reference_id` - 4-char identifier: "LOCL", "GPS.", "PPS.", "ATOM", or IP (default: "")
- `reference_timestamp` - When clock was last set (default: current_time)
- `origin_timestamp` - leave unset; the server copies the client's transmit time from the request
- `receive_timestamp` - When server received request (default: current_time)
- `transmit_timestamp` - When server sends response (default: current_time)

**Note**: leave `origin_timestamp` unset — the server writes the correct value.

#### `send_ntp_response` (Advanced)

Send a complete packet as hex, at least 96 hex characters (48 bytes). The field is decoded strictly
as hex: whitespace, `:` separators and a leading `0x` are stripped, anything else that fails to
decode returns an error instead of being sent as literal ASCII. Nothing is echoed into a raw packet,
so bytes 24-31 must hold the client's transmit timestamp or the reply will be discarded.

#### `ignore_request`

Don't send any response.

### Example LLM Response

```json
{
  "actions": [
    {
      "type": "send_ntp_time_response",
      "stratum": 2
    },
    {
      "type": "show_message",
      "message": "Sent NTP time response as stratum 2 server"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Example: Stratum 1 Server

```json
{
  "actions": [
    {
      "type": "send_ntp_time_response",
      "stratum": 1,
      "reference_id": "GPS.",
      "precision": -20,
      "root_delay": 0.001,
      "root_dispersion": 0.001
    }
  ]
}
```

## Connection Management

### Connection Lifecycle

1. **Request Received**: UDP datagram on port 123
2. **Parse**: Extract client's transmit timestamp (bytes 40-47)
3. **Register**: Create ConnectionId and add to ServerInstance
4. **Process**:
   - **Default (no operator policy)** → build the static time response directly, **no LLM call**
   - **Opt-in only** (instruction or handler) → call the handler/LLM with the `ntp_request` event
5. **Auto-Inject**: Echo origin_timestamp if not provided
6. **Build**: Construct 48-byte NTP response packet
7. **Respond**: Send UDP response
8. **Update**: Track bytes/packets sent/received
9. **Persist**: Connection remains in UI

### NTP Packet Structure

Fixed 48-byte packet:

- Byte 0: LI (2 bits) + Version (3 bits) + Mode (3 bits)
- Byte 1: Stratum
- Byte 2: Poll interval
- Byte 3: Precision
- Bytes 4-7: Root delay (32-bit fixed point)
- Bytes 8-11: Root dispersion (32-bit fixed point)
- Bytes 12-15: Reference ID (4 ASCII chars)
- Bytes 16-23: Reference timestamp (64-bit NTP timestamp)
- Bytes 24-31: Origin timestamp (64-bit NTP timestamp)
- Bytes 32-39: Receive timestamp (64-bit NTP timestamp)
- Bytes 40-47: Transmit timestamp (64-bit NTP timestamp)

**NTP Timestamp Format**: 64 bits = 32-bit seconds + 32-bit fraction (1/2^32 seconds precision)

## Known Limitations

### 1. NTPv1-v4 Only

- Accepts any version in requests and answers in the same version (default 4)
- No NTPv5 support (still in draft)
- The mode field of the request is reported to the LLM as `client_mode` but not enforced: a mode 4
  or mode 5 packet is answered as if it were a client query, so pointing two NetGet NTP servers at
  each other would loop

### 2. No NTP Extensions

- No extension fields beyond 48-byte basic packet
- No authentication (NTP extensions)
- No autokey or symmetric key authentication

### 3. No Stratum 0

- Server can't act as primary reference clock (stratum 0 is reserved)
- Can act as stratum 1 (primary) or 2-15 (secondary)
- No integration with actual hardware clocks (GPS, atomic, etc.)

### 4. Simplified Time Handling

- Uses system time (SystemTime::now())
- No clock discipline algorithms
- No tracking of time offset or drift
- Just returns current system time with NTP formatting

### 5. No NTP Control Protocol

- Only implements client/server mode (mode 3 request → mode 4 response)
- No broadcast mode (mode 5)
- No NTP control messages (ntpq/ntpdc protocol)

### 6. No Kiss-of-Death

- Doesn't send Kiss-of-Death (KoD) packets to rate-limit clients
- No rate limiting or denial-of-service protection

## Example Prompts

### Basic NTP Server

```
listen on port 123 via ntp
Respond to NTP requests with the current system time
Use stratum 2
```

### Stratum 1 Server

```
listen on port 123 via ntp
Act as a stratum 1 NTP server
Use reference ID "GPS." to indicate GPS time source
Set precision to -20 (1 microsecond)
```

### Custom Stratum Server

```
listen on port 123 via ntp
Act as a stratum 3 NTP server
Reference identifier: "LOCL" (local clock)
Poll interval: 6 (64 seconds)
```

### High-Precision Server

```
listen on port 123 via ntp
Respond with:
  - Stratum 1
  - Reference ID: "ATOM" (atomic clock)
  - Precision: -30 (1 nanosecond)
  - Root delay: 0.0001 seconds
  - Root dispersion: 0.00001 seconds
```

## Performance Characteristics

### Latency

- **With Scripting**: Sub-millisecond (script handles requests)
- **Without Scripting**: 2-5 seconds (one LLM call per request)
- Packet construction: ~5-10 microseconds (very fast)
- Timestamp extraction: ~1-2 microseconds

### Throughput

- **With Scripting**: Tens of thousands of requests per second
- **Without Scripting**: Limited by LLM (~0.2-0.5 requests/sec)
- NTP traffic is very low volume (clients poll every 64-1024 seconds)

### Scripting Compatibility

NTP is excellent candidate for scripting:

- Extremely simple logic (just return current time)
- No state machine
- Deterministic responses
- Very high query rate potential

When scripting enabled:

- Server startup generates script (1 LLM call)
- All requests handled by script (0 LLM calls)
- Script can get system time and format NTP response instantly

### Time Accuracy

- Accuracy limited by system clock (typically ±1-100ms)
- No hardware clock integration
- No clock discipline or offset correction
- Good enough for testing, not for production time service

## Failure behaviour

On `call_llm` returning `Err`, NTP sends a **Kiss-o'-Death** (RFC 5905 §7.4): LI 3, stratum 0,
and a four-character kiss code in the reference identifier — `RATE` when the backend is
saturated, `INIT` when it is unavailable. The client's transmit timestamp is echoed as the
origin timestamp, without which the reply is discarded as unrelated and we are back at
silence.

### Why this is a KoD and not the mechanical time response

For a long time this path sent the **static stratum-2 answer** — LI 0, LOCL, true current
time — and that was a fail-open. The argument for it was that the fallback is the server's
*own clock*, so it cannot be a lie in the operator's favour: an operator who opted into the
model in order to skew the time simply gets the truth instead.

That argument is about the *content* of the reply and misses what the reply **is**. A
stratum-2 packet is a positive assertion that this server is a usable time source, and the
client steps its clock from it. An operator who pointed NTP at a model asked for the model to
decide; answering anyway on the server's own authority when the backend is unreachable is
exactly the fail-open shape the root `CLAUDE.md` calls the most dangerous pattern in this
codebase.

A KoD is the one reply NTP defines that is **not** a time sample. `chrony`, `ntpd` and
`ntpdate` all recognise it, refuse to take time from it, and back off — so it fails closed
while still being a *reply*, which matters: silence looks like a merely slow server and the
client keeps polling. `decision=fail_closed_*` is therefore honest here, and
`grep decision=fail_closed` finds an NTP backend outage.

This directory previously had the doc and the test contradicting each other — the doc
described a KoD the code did not send, `build_kod_packet` sat called by nothing, and
`llm_failure_test.rs` asserted `buf[1] == 2` with the comment "not a Kiss-o'-Death". The doc
was rewritten to match the code, and then the code was changed to match what the doc had
always said. **Both tests now assert the stratum, so the wire and the token cannot drift
apart again**: a change back to an affirmative answer fails the stratum assertion before it
reaches the token.

### Every terminal outcome

| Outcome | On the wire | Log |
|---|---|---|
| No operator policy at all (`operator_wants_dynamic` false) — no model call is made | mechanical stratum-2 time response | INFO `decision=static_default` |
| Model answered with `send_ntp_time_response` / `send_ntp_response` | that packet | INFO `NTP request from <peer> decision=model_answer` |
| Model answered `ignore_request` | **nothing** | INFO `decision=model_reject` |
| Model answered with no usable action | **nothing**; the client keeps polling | WARN `decision=model_silent` |
| Executor refused the model's action (bad hex, short packet, unknown action) | **nothing** | ERROR `decision=fail_closed_bad_action` naming the action and the reason |
| Backend was saturated | **Kiss-o'-Death**, kiss code `RATE` | ERROR `decision=fail_closed_llm_overloaded category=overloaded` with the full error |
| Backend failed | **Kiss-o'-Death**, kiss code `INIT` | ERROR `decision=fail_closed_llm_error category=unavailable` with the full error |
| The KoD itself could not be sent | nothing | ERROR `decision=fail_closed_write_error` |
| The server's own static action failed to encode | nothing | ERROR/WARN `decision=fail_closed_action_error` |

The static send carries the token on its own line too
(`NTP static time response to <peer> (48 bytes) decision=static_default`), as does the KoD
(`NTP Kiss-o'-Death (INIT) to <peer> (48 bytes) decision=…`), so a no-policy answer and a
backend failure are never conflated.

The error text never reaches the wire: an NTP reply is 48 fixed binary bytes with no free-text
field, so there is nothing to leak into. `WireFailure::classify` is used only to put
`category=overloaded` / `category=unavailable` in the log.

Covered by `tests/server/ntp/llm_failure_test.rs` (decodes all 48 bytes by hand) and
`tests/server/ntp/decision_tag_test.rs` (asserts the tag on the failure path).

## Why there is only one client, and why that is not laziness

`rsntp` is the third-party peer, and it is a real one: not `#[ignore]`d, not skip-gated, and it
must **succeed**, validating the origin-timestamp echo, the mode and the leap indicator.

A second client is blocked by the tooling, not by effort. The reference clients are `sntp` and
`ntpdate` (ntp 4.2.8, both installed on this machine), and **neither accepts a port**:

```
$ sntp -t 2 '127.0.0.1:12345'
127.0.0.1:12345 lookup error nodename nor servname provided, or not known

$ ntpdate -q '127.0.0.1:12345'
Error resolving 127.0.0.1:12345: nodename nor servname provided, or not known (8)
```

`sntp`'s usage line is `sntp [ -<flag> [<val>] ] [hostname-or-IP ...]` with no `-p`, and
`ntpdate`'s `[-46bBdqsuv] [-a key#] [-e delay] [-k file] [-p samples] [-o version#] [-t timeo]`
uses `-p` for the sample count. Both take the bare address and go to port 123.

A test binds an ephemeral port, so aiming either at it means running the server on 123 as root.
**This is the same shape as `dhcp`**, whose metadata records that dhclient and ipconfig bind
UDP/68, need root, and cannot target an ephemeral loopback port — and it is why `dhcp` is not
Beta at all. NTP differs only in having one client that *can* be aimed.

If someone wants to close it: a privileged test that binds 123 would do it, and so would any
SNTP client that takes a port. Do not close it by pointing a hand-written decoder at the server
and calling that a second implementation — the project CLAUDE.md names that case explicitly
(`usb/serial`, `usb/smartcard`, `dhcp`, `torrent_tracker` before aria2c), and it is an
independent reading of the spec rather than an independent implementation.
