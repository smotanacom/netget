//! Hadoop YARN ResourceManager REST API server.
//!
//! Serves the ResourceManager web-service endpoints a real client / `curl` hits
//! (`/ws/v1/cluster/info|metrics|apps|nodes`, an app by id). The LLM roleplays the
//! cluster control plane, inventing applications, nodes and metrics per request.
//!
//! Static vs LLM-driven:
//! - `GET /ws/v1/cluster/info` — the version banner is purely mechanical and answered
//!   **statically** here, with no LLM round-trip.
//! - Anything unrecognised (not under `/ws/v1/cluster`) gets a static 404 RemoteException,
//!   again with no LLM call (keeps scanner noise off the model).
//! - `metrics`, `apps` (list + submit), `nodes`, app-by-id — **LLM-driven**.
//!
//! Fail-closed: on an LLM error, or when the model produces no `yarn_response`, the server
//! answers 503/500 with a YARN RemoteException envelope — never a success-shaped empty
//! cluster (which a client cannot distinguish from a genuinely idle cluster).
