# YARN — Hadoop YARN ResourceManager REST API server

The LLM roleplays a YARN cluster's ResourceManager and invents the applications, nodes and
metrics it reports (the Kubernetes/OCI "model is the control plane" pattern). NetGet owns the
HTTP stack (hyper v1, `http1::serve_connection`); the model only decides cluster state.

**Port**: 8088 (RM web UI/REST default). **Privilege**: `None` (8088 is unprivileged — do NOT
declare `PrivilegedPort`, it is > 1023 and would be dead code). **Stack**: `ETH>IP>TCP>HTTP>YARN`.
**State**: Experimental. No storage — the model supplies all state per request.

## Endpoints

| Method + path | Operation | Handled by |
|---|---|---|
| `GET /ws/v1/cluster` or `/ws/v1/cluster/info` | info | **static** (version banner, no LLM) |
| `GET /ws/v1/cluster/metrics` | metrics | LLM → `send_yarn_metrics` |
| `GET /ws/v1/cluster/apps` | apps | LLM → `send_yarn_apps` |
| `POST /ws/v1/cluster/apps/new-application` | new_application | LLM → `send_yarn_new_application` |
| `POST /ws/v1/cluster/apps` | submit | LLM → `send_yarn_submit_response` |
| `GET /ws/v1/cluster/apps/{appid}` | app | LLM → `send_yarn_app` |
| `GET /ws/v1/cluster/nodes` | nodes | LLM → `send_yarn_nodes` |
| `GET /ws/v1/cluster/nodes/{nodeid}` | node | LLM (reuse `send_yarn_nodes`/`send_yarn_error`) |
| anything else | unknown | **static** 404 RemoteException (no LLM) |

**Static vs LLM split**: `/ws/v1/cluster/info` is a purely mechanical version string, answered
directly in `mod.rs` from the `resource_manager_version` / `cluster_id` startup params — no model
round-trip. Unrecognised paths get a static 404 so scanner noise never bills the LLM. Everything
describing (invented) cluster *state* is LLM-driven.

## Response envelopes

Wrapped by `execute_action` to match the documented Hadoop `ResourceManagerRest` shapes:
`{"clusterInfo":{...}}`, `{"clusterMetrics":{...}}`, `{"apps":{"app":[...]}}` (empty list →
`{"apps":null}`, the real YARN idiom), `{"app":{...}}`, `{"nodes":{"node":[...]}}`,
`{"application-id":...,"maximum-resource-capability":{...}}`. Submit acceptance is `202 Accepted`
with an **empty body + `Location` header** (no Content-Type), exactly as YARN replies.

## Events / actions

One event type, `yarn_request`, emitted for every LLM-handled request (info/unknown short-circuit
before it). It declares the full action set via `.with_actions(...)`, and every action is
reachable from some operation, so nothing is declared-but-unemitted.

Actions: `send_yarn_metrics`, `send_yarn_apps`, `send_yarn_app`, `send_yarn_nodes`,
`send_yarn_new_application`, `send_yarn_submit_response`, `send_yarn_error`. All parameters are
structured JSON (objects/arrays/numbers) — never raw bytes or base64. `yarn_response` is the
internal `ActionResult::Custom` name, not an action the model emits.

## Fail-closed

On an LLM error the server answers **503** (`ServiceUnavailableException`, overload/retryable) or
**500** (`WebApplicationException`) with a `RemoteException` envelope. When the model succeeds but
emits no `yarn_response`, the server answers **500** rather than a success-shaped empty cluster —
an empty-but-200 `{"apps":null}` is a valid statement that the cluster is idle and a client cannot
tell it from a backend that never ran. The failure path is structurally distinct from a real empty
cluster.

## Startup parameters

Both optional and both actually read in `spawn()`:
- `resource_manager_version` (default `3.3.6`) — the version in the static info banner.
- `cluster_id` (default `1476912658570`) — the RM start epoch-ms / cluster id in the banner.

`send_first` is not declared (nothing to send before the client issues a request).

## Limitations

No scheduler/queue endpoints, no app-attempts/containers sub-resources, no RM HA failover, no auth
(SPNEGO/delegation tokens). HTTP/1.1 only. Cluster state is virtual and lives only in the model's
context across a conversation.

## Connection bounds

Before September 2026 this server accepted without limit and bounded no read in time, so a peer
that connected and said nothing held a socket, a connection task and an `AppState` entry forever,
pre-authentication, on a server that would happily accept a hundred more. It now declares both
halves; the constants and the reasoning live beside them in `src/server/yarn/mod.rs`.

| Bound | Value | Why this number |
|---|---|---|
| `FIRST_BYTE_READ_TIMEOUT` | 30s | HTTP is client-speaks-first, so a peer that has connected and sent no byte has begun no request. 30s sits between nginx's `client_header_timeout` default of 60s and Apache's `RequestReadTimeout header=20`. Enforced with `TcpStream::peek` before the socket reaches hyper, so the request line is still there for hyper afterwards. |
| `IDLE_BETWEEN_REQUESTS_TIMEOUT` | 180s | The ResourceManager REST API is polled on a seconds-to-minutes cycle, so the silence measured is a poller that has stopped polling. Three minutes is above any scrape interval anyone configures and more than twice nginx's `keepalive_timeout` default. |
| `MAX_CONNECTIONS` | 256 | Each admitted connection may hold one whole in-memory response body (a JSON response), so the cap turns that per-connection bound into a total one. Refusal: **HTTP/1.1 `503 Service Unavailable` with `Retry-After: 5`** — a 503 is what a REST client and a dashboard both already understand. Nothing of netget's reaches the wire; the reason is logged under `decision=fail_closed_connection_cap`. |

**The idle bound is a watchdog, not a read deadline, and that is not a stylistic choice.** hyper
owns every read once `serve_connection` starts and keeps polling the connection for new frames
*while a request is being answered*, so a deadline on those reads would fire in the middle of an
LLM round-trip. It watches `ConnectionActivity` instead, which reports a connection with work in
flight as not idle at all — so the model round-trip, and a `manual` rule parking an event for a
human (`src/state/intercepts.rs`, 300s by default), sit outside every deadline by construction.
That is the `.connectionless()` lesson in the project `CLAUDE.md` read in reverse: TFTP evicted
live transfers because "idle" was measured wrongly.

**One residual, stated rather than hidden.** The first-byte bound is discharged the moment any
byte arrives, so a peer that sends one byte of a request line and then stops is bounded by the
*idle* deadline (180s) rather than by the 30s one. hyper's own `header_read_timeout` cannot
express the pair: it re-arms whenever hyper starts reading a head, an idle keep-alive connection
included, so setting it to 30s would close every pooled client between requests — collapsing the
two bounds onto one number, which is exactly what the pair exists to avoid.

`tests/server/yarn/connection_bounds_test.rs` drives all three from the wire, over
`tests/helpers/http_bounds.rs`. Each was verified by **removing** the bound and watching the test
fail: with the `peek` deadline gone the silent peer still held the socket at 60s; with the idle
bound collapsed to 30s an answered connection was closed after 38s of silence; with the permit
released early the connection past the cap was served instead of refused.
