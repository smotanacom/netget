# Pseudo-Terminal (PTY) Protocol Implementation

Impersonates a program with a terminal. The server allocates a PTY with `openpty`, holds the
**master**, and role-plays: it reads what a terminal program types on the **slave**
(`pty_input_received`) and the model decides the bytes that appear on the terminal
(`write_pty_output`). A real client is any terminal program that opens the slave device —
`screen ./netget.pty`, `cat ./netget.pty`, a Python `open('/dev/ttysNNN')`.

**State**: Experimental. **Platform**: Unix only; the whole module is `#![cfg(unix)]`.
**Privilege**: none — a PTY is an unprivileged user resource.

## Master/slave orientation (important)

Normally a terminal emulator holds the master and the application holds the slave. Here it is
**inverted**: NetGet (the roleplayed program) holds the master, and the real client holds the
slave. Consequently:

- `write_pty_output` writes to the master → appears as bytes the client reads off the slave
  (what shows "on the terminal").
- The client writing to the slave → readable on the master → NetGet reads it as
  `pty_input_received`.

The slave is put in **raw mode** (`cfmakeraw`): echo off and canonical line-buffering off. Echo
off is essential — otherwise bytes written to the master would echo straight back and NetGet would
read its own output. Canonical off means bytes flow immediately without waiting for a newline, so
a prompt like `netget$ ` (no newline) reaches the client at once.

We use **libc directly** (`openpty`, `tcgetattr`/`cfmakeraw`/`tcsetattr`, `ttyname_r`, `fcntl`)
rather than `nix`, because `nix` is a dev-only dependency in this crate.

## Startup

| Parameter | Required | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `link_path` | no | symlink to create pointing at the allocated slave device, so a client can open a stable path |
| `send_first` | no | raise `pty_opened` on startup so the model can print a banner/prompt first |

No port; `default_binding()` returns empty binding defaults so `server_startup.rs` does not demand
one. `link_path` is symlinked to the kernel-assigned `/dev/ttysNNN`; an existing **symlink** there
is replaced, but a regular file/dir is refused rather than clobbered (same guard shape as
`socket_file`).

## What the model sees and controls

**Events**

- `pty_opened` — `slave_path`. Emitted once at startup, only under `send_first` (same conditional
  pattern as `socket_file_connection_opened`).
- `pty_input_received` — `data` + `encoding`. Emitted whenever the terminal program writes/types.

**Action**: `write_pty_output` — `data` + optional `encoding` (`"utf8"` default, `"hex"` for ANSI
escape sequences / binary). Both events attach this action, so the model always has a usable
vocabulary. Explicit encoding, no auto-detection, invalid hex is an action error not a panic —
the `send_tcp_data` lesson.

## Why the master never spins on EIO

Reading a PTY master returns `EIO` when **no** process holds the slave open. The server therefore
keeps its own `OwnedFd` on the slave open for the whole session, so clients can attach and detach
freely without ending the server; the read loop also treats a stray `EIO` as "no client attached"
and continues rather than dying.

That `continue` is only safe because it is preceded by `guard.clear_ready()`. `AsyncFd::try_io`
drops the cached readiness **only** when the closure reports `WouldBlock`; on any other outcome
readiness stays set, so the next `readable().await` returns instantly and the loop pins a core.
The heading is a claim about the code, not about the kernel — before the `clear_ready()` calls,
an `EIO` (or a `read()==0`) would have spun in exactly the way this heading calls impossible.

## Failure and lifecycle

- **`spawn()` awaits readiness** (PTY allocated, slave set raw, symlink created, master registered
  with the runtime) and returns `Err` on any failure → `ServerStatus::Error`.
- **Fail closed, but not silent**, on LLM error. A terminal client has no timeout of its own — it
  simply sits there — so writing nothing is the worst outcome. `dispatch` classifies the error with
  `crate::utils::WireFailure` and writes a **category only**:
  `\r\n[netget: backend at capacity, retry later]\r\n` for `Overloaded`,
  `\r\n[netget: request could not be processed]\r\n` for `Unavailable`. CRLF on both sides because
  `cfmakeraw` clears `ONLCR`, and a leading CRLF keeps the notice off a half-typed line. The error
  itself — backend URL, model name, `anyhow` chain — goes to `tracing::error!` and the status
  stream and **never** to the terminal.
- Three outcomes are distinguishable in the log by their `decision=` tag: `model_no_output` (the
  model answered with no `write_pty_output` — a legitimate answer on a terminal, so nothing is
  written), `fail_closed_overloaded`, and `fail_closed_llm_error`. PTY has no reject/deny verb, so
  there is no `model_reject` case to separate.
- The read/dispatch loop is registered via `register_server_task`, so `stop_server` aborts it and
  releases the fds. A `LinkCleanup` guard moved into the task removes the symlink on stop/abort.
- Processing is **serial** (a terminal is a serial line): read a chunk → one LLM round-trip →
  write output → repeat. Input arriving during an LLM call waits in the PTY buffer.

## Not implemented

Window size (`TIOCSWINSZ`) / `SIGWINCH`, job control / signals (raw mode disables `ISIG`),
multiple concurrent clients as distinct sessions, and any accumulation state machine.

## Verified

`tests/server/pty/e2e_test.rs`: a real terminal client opens the slave through the symlink, reads
the model's `netget$ ` banner (master→slave), types `whoami\n` (slave→master, surfaced as
`pty_input_received`), and reads the model's `root\n` answer. Asserts actual bytes on the
terminal.
