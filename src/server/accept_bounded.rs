//! A connection cap for accept loops, and the refusal that says why.
//!
//! # The problem this closes
//!
//! Every TCP accept loop in this tree used to accept without limit. A peer that connects and
//! says nothing holds a socket, a task and an [`AppState`](crate::state::app_state::AppState)
//! connection entry for as long as it likes; a thousand of them is a free denial of service,
//! pre-authentication, on a server that will happily accept a thousand more. Per-connection
//! read timeouts bound how long *one* peer can stall, and are the other half of this — but a
//! timeout alone still lets an attacker hold `timeout × rate` connections at once. Only a cap
//! turns "bounded per connection" into "bounded".
//!
//! # Why it refuses out loud
//!
//! A cap that silently drops the socket is worse than no cap at all: the client cannot tell a
//! full server from a crashed one, so it retries immediately and forever, and the operator
//! sees an outage with no cause. So [`accept_bounded`] writes the caller's own bytes before
//! closing, and each protocol supplies the phrasing its *own* clients already understand —
//! MySQL error 1040, RESP `-ERR max number of clients reached`, HTTP `503`, and so on. The
//! bytes live in each protocol's `mod.rs`, not here: a table of per-protocol literals in a
//! shared module would be exactly the centralised per-protocol logic this codebase forbids.
//! This module knows only "some bytes, or none".
//!
//! Where a protocol has no way to say it — the peer speaks first and every server message is a
//! positive assertion — the right answer is an empty slice and a plain close, for the same
//! reason twenty protocols are deliberately silent on an LLM failure: a fabricated reply is
//! worse than silence. The refusal is still logged, and the log line is the diagnosis.
//!
//! # Usage
//!
//! ```ignore
//! const MAX_CONNECTIONS: usize = accept_bounded::DEFAULT_MAX_CONNECTIONS;
//! const BUSY: &[u8] = b"-ERR max number of clients reached\r\n";
//!
//! let limiter = ConnectionLimiter::new(MAX_CONNECTIONS);
//! loop {
//!     let (socket, peer, permit) =
//!         match accept_bounded(&listener, &limiter, BUSY, "REDIS", Some(&status_tx)).await {
//!             Ok(v) => v,
//!             Err(e) => { /* the listener itself failed; break */ }
//!         };
//!     tokio::spawn(async move {
//!         let _permit = permit; // held for the life of the connection
//!         handle(socket).await;
//!     });
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! [`accept_bounded`] never returns a refused connection: it loops internally, so the caller's
//! loop only ever sees peers that were admitted. The [`ConnectionPermit`] it returns must be
//! moved into the connection task — dropping it early releases the slot while the connection
//! is still live, which silently un-caps the server.
