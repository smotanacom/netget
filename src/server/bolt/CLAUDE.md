# Bolt Protocol Implementation (Neo4j)

Neo4j's **Bolt** protocol — the binary protocol every Neo4j driver and `cypher-shell` speaks to
a Neo4j graph database. The model is the graph database: it decides whether a login is accepted
and what each Cypher query returns. NetGet stores no graph, owns the whole protocol state
machine, and writes every byte.

**State**: Beta (see Maturity). **Privilege**: `None` — the well-known port is 7687.
**Stack**: `ETH>IP>TCP>BOLT`. **Feature**: `bolt` (no dependencies).

## Library choice

None. The crates on crates.io (`bolt-proto`, `bolt-client`, `neo4rs`) are client-side or
Bolt-4-era, and none states the property the decoder needs most: that a peer cannot make it
recurse without bound or allocate what the bytes do not contain. PackStream is ~300 lines
(`packstream.rs`), so it is hand-written with both guards explicit.

## Files

| File | What it holds |
|---|---|
| `mod.rs` | accept loop, handshake, the session loop and state machine, streaming, ROUTE, the admin queries |
| `packstream.rs` | `Value`, `decode` (depth-bounded, declared lengths checked), `encode` (smallest form), `chunk`, `Dechunker` (1 MiB cap) |
| `messages.rs` | handshake negotiation, request tags and `parse_request`, SUCCESS / RECORD / IGNORED / FAILURE builders |
| `values.rs` | model JSON → PackStream (with `$node` / `$relationship` / `$path`), parameters → JSON, stats, failure-code validation, `query_answer` |
| `actions.rs` | the `Protocol`/`Server` impls, five actions, two events |

## What the real client sends (captured before writing this)

`cypher-shell` 2026.09.0 (Java, neo4j-java-driver 6.2.1) was pointed at a raw TCP recorder
(a Python script answering SUCCESS to everything) with `-a bolt://…` and `-a neo4j://…`, both
one-shot and interactive (through a pty), and with `:begin`/`:commit`, `-d`, `-P` and
`--access-mode read`. What it sent:

```
handshake 60 60 b0 17 | 00 00 01 ff | 00 08 08 05 | 00 02 04 04 | 00 00 00 03
          magic        manifest v1   5.8 range 8   4.4 range 2   3.0
>> HELLO  {user_agent: "neo4j-cypher-shell/v2026.09.0",
           bolt_agent: {product: "neo4j-java/6.2.1-…", language: "Java/21", …},
           routing: {address: "127.0.0.1:7687"}}          # routing only for neo4j://
>> LOGON  {scheme: "basic", principal: "neo4j", credentials: "<password>"}
>> ROUTE  [{address: …}, [], {}]                           # neo4j:// only, then RESET
>> RUN    "CALL db.ping()" {} {tx_metadata: {type: "system", app: "cypher-shell_v2026.09.0"}}
>> PULL   {n: 1000}                                         # pipelined with the RUN
>> RESET
>> RUN    "CALL dbms.licenseAgreementDetails()" {} {…system…}   + PULL, RESET
>> RUN    "<the user's query>" {params} {tx_metadata: {type: "user-direct"}, db?, mode: "r"?}
>> PULL   {n: 1000}
>> RESET
>> BEGIN  {tx_metadata, db?, mode?}  … RUN "<q>" {params} {} + PULL {n: 1000} … COMMIT   # :begin/:commit
>> GOODBYE
```

Two things the recorder established that the specification would not have told us:

- **The driver refuses a HELLO `server` agent that does not start `Neo4j/`** ("Server does not
  identify as a genuine Neo4j instance"). The agent is `Neo4j/<neo4j_version>`, default 5.26.0.
- **From Bolt 5.7 a FAILURE must be the GQL error object.** Answering 5.8 with the pre-5.7
  `{code, message}` made cypher-shell die with a Java `NullPointerException` reading a field
  that was not there.

## Version

The first client proposal overlapping **5.0–5.8** wins, at the highest minor both sides speak.
cypher-shell 2026.09 offers the 5.7+ handshake manifest first; it names major 255 and is passed
over, so cypher-shell falls back to its plain `5.8 range 8` proposal and gets **5.8**. The
manifest (which is how a client reaches Bolt 6) is not implemented. Nothing overlapping →
`00 00 00 00` and close (`decision=fail_closed_no_common_version`); not the Bolt magic → close
without an answer (`decision=fail_closed_bad_magic`).

Why 5.8 and not lower: every 5.x difference that matters here is small and implemented — 5.0
carries credentials in HELLO (handled: the auth event is raised from HELLO and a success moves
straight to READY), 5.1+ splits auth into LOGON/LOGOFF, 5.4 adds TELEMETRY (answered SUCCESS),
5.7 changes the FAILURE shape (both shapes are rendered, by negotiated minor). 5.6's GQL
statuses in summaries and 5.8's home-database hints are optional server metadata and are not
sent.

FAILURE on 5.7+: `{gql_status: "50N42", description: "error: general processing exception -
unexpected error. <message>", message, neo4j_code: <code>, diagnostic_record: {OPERATION: "",
OPERATION_CODE: "0", CURRENT_SCHEMA: "/"}}`. `50N42` is Neo4j's own status for an error with no
more specific GQL mapping; the driver classifies on `neo4j_code`. The real-client test asserts
`ClientException` for a `Neo.ClientError.Statement.*` code and `AuthenticationException` for
`Unauthorized`; `TransientException`, `SecurityException` (`Security.Forbidden`),
`FatalDiscoveryException` (`Database.DatabaseNotFound`) and `DatabaseException` were checked by
hand against their codes with `--error-format stacktrace`.

## State machine (NetGet's, never the model's)

| State | Accepts | Goes to |
|---|---|---|
| CONNECTED | HELLO | AUTHENTICATION (5.1+) / READY (5.0, after the auth event) |
| AUTHENTICATION | LOGON | READY on accept; FAILURE and **close** on reject |
| READY | RUN, BEGIN, ROUTE, LOGOFF, TELEMETRY (5.4+) | STREAMING / TX_READY / READY / AUTHENTICATION / READY |
| STREAMING | PULL, DISCARD | READY when the result is drained, else STREAMING (`has_more: true`) |
| TX_READY | RUN, COMMIT, ROLLBACK | TX_STREAMING / READY / READY |
| TX_STREAMING | RUN (another result, new `qid`), PULL, DISCARD (by `qid`, `-1` = last opened) | TX_READY when every result is drained |
| FAILED | — everything but RESET/GOODBYE is **IGNORED** | READY on RESET |
| any | RESET → READY (or AUTHENTICATION if not logged in), GOODBYE → close | |

- **INTERRUPTED**: a message already received *ahead of* a RESET the client has also sent is
  answered IGNORED without being handled. This is checked over messages already in the buffer;
  a model call already in flight is not cancelled — the RESET is handled after it answers.
- **Anything else** (a PULL in READY, COMMIT with a result still open, RUN before LOGON, an
  unknown tag) is FAILURE `Neo.ClientError.Request.Invalid` "Message 'X' cannot be handled by
  a session in the Y state." and a close (`decision=fail_closed_protocol_violation`).
- Messages are handled strictly in order; pipelined RUN+PULL is the normal case.

## What the model sees and controls

| Event | Data | Actions |
|---|---|---|
| `bolt_authenticate` | `user_agent`, `scheme`, `principal`, `credentials_present`, `password_configured` — **never the credential** | `accept_bolt_login`, `reject_bolt_login {code?, message?}` (code must be `Neo.ClientError.Security.*`, default `…Unauthorized`), `close_connection` |
| `bolt_query` | `query`, `parameters` (JSON), `database` (when named), `mode: read\|write`, `in_transaction` | `send_bolt_records {fields, records, stats?, query_type?}`, `send_bolt_failure {code, message}`, `close_connection` |

`send_bolt_records` is validated before anything is sent: each record must have exactly one
value per field, field names non-empty and distinct, `query_type` one of `r`/`w`/`rw`/`s`
(default `r`), `stats` keys among Neo4j's counters (`nodes_created` or `nodes-created`, …,
non-negative integers; `contains-updates` / `contains-system-updates` derived). A refused answer
is `decision=fail_closed_invalid_answer`. `send_bolt_failure` codes must have the shape
`Neo.{ClientError|TransientError|DatabaseError}.<Category>.<Title>`.

### Values

Plain JSON maps to PackStream the obvious way (integers that fit i64 → INT, other numbers →
FLOAT, strings, booleans, null, lists, maps). Three single-key objects are graph values:

```json
{"$node": {"id": 1, "labels": ["Person"], "properties": {"name": "Alice"}, "element_id": "…"?}}
{"$relationship": {"id": 7, "type": "KNOWS", "start": 1, "end": 2, "properties": {}}}
{"$path": {"nodes": [{…node…}, …], "relationships": [{…rel…}, …]}}
```

Nodes are Bolt 5 `Node` structures (4 fields, `element_id` defaulting to the id as a string),
relationships 8-field `Relationship`s. In a path, `relationships[i]` must join `nodes[i]` and
`nodes[i+1]` in **either** direction; NetGet dedupes nodes and relationships and computes the
index sequence (1-based relationship index, negative when traversed against its direction;
0-based node index). cypher-shell renders all three as graph values — the real-client test
asserts `(:Person {…})-[:ACTED_IN {…}]->(:Movie {…})` and the `<-[…]-` form. **Not supported:**
temporal and spatial values (give them as strings), bytes. Model values are bounded to the same
32 levels the decoder accepts.

Parameters reach the model as JSON; bytes become `{"$bytes_length": n}` and any structure
(a `date()` parameter, a node) becomes `{"$structure": "Date", "fields": […]}`.

### Answered by NetGet, never by the model

HELLO, ROUTE, BEGIN, COMMIT (`bookmark`), ROLLBACK, RESET, LOGOFF, TELEMETRY, GOODBYE, all
IGNORED/FAILURE mechanics, and the admin queries cypher-shell runs on every connect, matched on
the whole query (case- and whitespace-insensitive):

| Query | Answer |
|---|---|
| `CALL db.ping()` | `success: true` |
| `CALL dbms.licenseAgreementDetails()` | `status: "yes", daysLeftOnTrial: 0, totalTrialDays: 0` — cypher-shell reads `status`; `yes` prints nothing |
| `CALL dbms.components()` | `name: "Neo4j Kernel", versions: [<neo4j_version>], edition: "community"` |
| `CALL dbms.components() YIELD versions` | `versions: [<neo4j_version>]` |

So connecting cypher-shell costs exactly one event (the login), and a one-shot query one more.
`SHOW DATABASES` and friends are not special-cased: cypher-shell does not send them on connect,
and when a user does, the model answers.

ROUTE answers a one-server routing table (`ttl: 300`, the requested `db` or `neo4j`, WRITE /
READ / ROUTE all naming one address). The address is the one the client put in its routing
context — what it dialled — so `neo4j://` clients come back to this server; failing that, the
listener's own address.

A write's summary (query type other than `r`, auto-commit) carries a `bookmark`; COMMIT always
does. Bookmarks are opaque `FB:netget:<server>:<ms>` strings — NetGet stores nothing, so no
causal-consistency guarantee is implied.

### The password

`password` (startup parameter): NetGet compares a basic-auth credential against it in constant
time; a mismatch, or any non-basic scheme, is FAILURE `Neo.ClientError.Security.Unauthorized`
and a close (`decision=reject_bad_credentials`) **without raising the event**. With it unset,
every login reaches `bolt_authenticate`, which decides with `credentials_present` and the
principal. The credential is in no event and no log line either way (asserted by
`state_machine_test.rs`).

## Failure behaviour

`FailureMode::Answers` (`.answers_on_failure()`).

| Cause | On the wire | Log |
|---|---|---|
| backend failed | FAILURE `Neo.TransientError.General.DatabaseUnavailable`, fixed message per `WireFailure` category ("…unavailable…" / "…at capacity; retry…") | `decision=fail_closed_llm_error category=…` |
| answer refused by the executor | same FAILURE | `decision=fail_closed_invalid_answer` |
| nothing answered | same FAILURE | `decision=model_silent` |
| a login answer to a query (or vice versa) | same FAILURE | `decision=fail_closed_mismatched_reply` |
| the model's own failure | FAILURE with its code and message | `decision=model_reject` |
| rows | SUCCESS / RECORD… / SUCCESS | `decision=model_answer` |

For a **query**, the connection enters FAILED and recovers on RESET — Bolt's own path, which
every driver takes. For a **login**, the connection closes: a login nobody could decide is
refused, never admitted (a backend outage must not open the database). No error text reaches
the client; the messages are constants.

## Bounds

| Bound | Value | Override | Why |
|---|---|---|---|
| `MAX_MESSAGE_BYTES` (= `max_inbound_bytes`) | 1 MiB summed over a message's chunks | — | Checked on each chunk's declared size before its payload is awaited, so a stream that never sends the zero chunk cannot grow past it. Refusal: FAILURE `Neo.ClientError.Request.Invalid`, close, `decision=fail_closed_message_too_large`. |
| `MAX_PACKSTREAM_DEPTH` | 32 | — | One byte opens a level; without it ~100 KB of `0x91` overflows the stack and kills the process (verified). Refusal: FAILURE `Request.Invalid`, close, `decision=fail_closed_too_deep`. |
| declared lengths | ≤ bytes remaining | — | A LIST_32 header declares four billion entries in five bytes; counts are checked (an element ≥ 1 byte, a map entry ≥ 2) before `Vec::with_capacity`. |
| `FIRST_BYTE_TIMEOUT` | 30 s for the whole 20-byte handshake | `first_byte_timeout_secs` | Bolt is client-first and drivers send the handshake with the connect. Half a handshake does not reset the clock. |
| `IDLE_TIMEOUT` | 300 s between messages | `idle_timeout_secs` | Drivers pool connections and leave them idle between queries. Wraps the read only, so a query parked on a `manual` rule is never closed by it. |
| `MAX_CONNECTIONS` | 256 (house default) | — | The peer past the cap is closed without a handshake answer (Bolt has nothing to say before the handshake). |

Every close lingers (2 s / 64 KiB) so a FAILURE sent with pipelined input still unread arrives
before FIN rather than being destroyed by an RST.

## Peer handle

Registered for every connection, so the dashboard's `[ disconnect ]` works (`close_connection`
half-closes, the peer reads EOF). `[ message ]` accepts and validates an answer action but
writes nothing: Bolt defines no server-initiated message, and bytes out of turn would
desynchronise the client's response queue. `peer_inject_test.rs` asserts both.

## Wireshark

This Wireshark build (4.6.8) has no Bolt dissector — `tshark -G protocols` lists nothing matching
bolt, neo4j or packstream — so `src/tui/wireshark.rs` maps `bolt` to plain TCP and there is no
pcap-oracle test.

## Maturity

Beta. Evidence: `tests/server/bolt/real_client_test.rs` drives Neo4j's own `cypher-shell`
(Java, neo4j-java-driver 6.2; not linked, not written by us, and the server uses no Bolt
library) through rows, nodes, relationships and paths both ways, write statistics, a
model-chosen error classified by the driver, a wrong password, an explicit transaction with
`-d` and `-P`, `neo4j://` routing, and a mocked model's rows. It is not `#[ignore]`d and fails,
never skips, when cypher-shell or its Java runtime is absent; CI's `registry-audit` installs the
release zip and runs it. Promoted after the whole suite passed three consecutive runs at
`--test-threads=100` and `scripts/beta_evidence_table.py --check` stayed green with
`cypher-shell` ✓ as the peer.

What would still be missing for Stable: a second independent client (the Python `neo4j`
driver, or a Go/JS driver — condition 1); a pcap oracle (no dissector exists — condition 2).
A fuzz target exists (`fuzz/fuzz_targets/packstream_message.rs`, depth-bomb and
huge-declared-length seeds; verified to crash with the depth guard removed, then 60 s clean).
