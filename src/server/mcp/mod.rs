//! MCP (Model Context Protocol) server implementation
//!
//! This module implements an MCP server that allows LLM to control all server capabilities.
//! MCP is built on JSON-RPC 2.0 and provides a standardized way for LLM applications
//! to access external resources, tools, and prompts.
//!
//! Key features:
//! - JSON-RPC 2.0 over HTTP/SSE transport
//! - Full LLM control over resources, tools, and prompts
//! - Session-based state management
//! - Three-phase initialization (initialize → response → initialized)
//! - Support for resource subscriptions, tool execution, and prompt templates
