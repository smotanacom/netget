# OTLP HTTP and gRPC receiver

Feature `otlp` exposes one receiver on the configured TCP port. The existing HTTP/1.1
paths/encodings remain supported. Hyper's auto connection builder also admits HTTP/2,
including generated tonic unary Export services for traces, metrics and logs on that
same port. 4318 remains the default port; use 4317 explicitly for a conventional gRPC
endpoint. Receiver TLS is outside this subset; the exporter supports authenticated TLS.

`mod.rs` owns bounded accept/connection tasks, HTTP handling and the shared verdict path.
`grpc.rs` routes generated services, admits RPCs before decoding, bounds unary bodies,
and owns Hyper HTTP/2 child tasks. `codec.rs` provides bounded protobuf/JSON summary walks
and all response encoders. `actions.rs` declares the semantic export event and verdicts.

The OpenTelemetry project's opentelemetry-proto 0.29 generated messages/services preserve
the repository's tonic 0.12/prost 0.13 family. gRPC framing, codec/compression, status and
trailers remain library-owned. `vendor/tonic/README.netget.md` documents its minimal
receive-limit patch: 4 MiB is enforced before and after decompression in either direction.

## Requests and semantic decisions

HTTP POST /v1/traces, /v1/metrics and /v1/logs accepts protobuf or OTLP JSON, with optional
gzip. Content-Type parameters are ignored. Unknown JSON fields are ignored; lowerCamelCase
and snake_case, integer numbers/strings and status names/numbers are supported. JSON is walked
as Value because the generated serde layer is narrower than exporter interoperability.

gRPC paths are the standard opentelemetry.proto.collector.{trace,metrics,logs}.v1
{Trace,Metrics,Logs}Service/Export methods. Requests/responses use generated protobuf and
none/gzip compression. One framed Export message is required. The guard bounds the total
wire body at 4 MiB+5, validates the declared message length before further accumulation, and
rejects extra or incomplete frames before tonic decoding. It prevents tonic's unary trailer
drain from consuming arbitrary additional messages. Request trailer metadata is ignored.

Both transports raise `otlp_export` with a bounded summary, never raw telemetry or IDs:
transport, signal, encoding, compressed, body_bytes, resource_count, service name(s), up to 20
first-resource scalar attributes (values cut 200 bytes), span/error counts and first 10 names,
metric/data-point counts and first 10 names, or log/error counts and first 5 bodies cut 200 bytes.
Arrays/maps/bytes are described by size rather than expanded. The event carries answer_with.

The first semantic verdict is sent:

| Action | HTTP | gRPC |
|---|---|---|
| accept_otlp |200 empty Export response|OK empty generated response|
| accept_otlp_partially |200 partial_success|OK partial_success|
| reject_otlp |declared allowed status + google.rpc.Status|mapped gRPC status, optional RetryInfo|

Partial counts are clamped to the export's item count. Allowed refusal statuses are
400/401/403/413/429/500/502/503/504, mapped to the codec's corresponding gRPC code. HTTP
Retry-After is sent only for 429/502/503/504. gRPC supplies google.rpc.RetryInfo when that
delay is present; RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED without RetryInfo is permanently nonretryable.
Backend overload fails closed 503/UNAVAILABLE, other backend failures 500/INTERNAL, each
with a fixed category message. No usable verdict fails closed 500/INTERNAL. No backend
error text is sent. Responses update connection statistics; gRPC request statistics count
decoded protobuf bytes and requests. There is no receiver storage/forwarding/domain state.

## Ownership and bounds

The accept loop and each connection belong to AppState. A connection owns an executor
guard which aborts every Hyper HTTP/2 child task on exit/removal, including a parked manual
handler. Finished handles are pruned. This explicit guard works even when executor clones
remain inside a child task. Operation permits drop on completion, cancellation or deadline.

| Bound | Value |
|---|---|
| TCP connections |256; overflow HTTP 503 + Retry-After 5 then close|
| First byte |30s|
| Idle between requests |120s; an active request is not idle|
| HTTP body before/after gzip |4MiB|
| gRPC message before/after gzip |4MiB; overflow RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED without RetryInfo|
| gRPC unary raw body |4MiB+5; one message|
| HTTP/2 concurrent streams/connection |16|
| HTTP/2 initial stream/connection window |64KiB /1MiB|
| HTTP/2 header list/frame |32KiB /16KiB|
| Global active gRPC exports |64, acquired before reading/decoding; overflow UNAVAILABLE|
| Whole gRPC request |30s, including body and model; smaller valid grpc-timeout honored|
| Nesting |prost 100 / serde_json 128; NetGet summaries do not recurse into attributes|

HTTP routing failures retain 404/405+Allow/415/400/413 behavior. A gRPC prefix/body bound
fails closed before asking the model. Client cancellation and receiver removal drop parked
handlers. This remains request-only: no unprompted receiver message action exists.

Expanded surface is Experimental. The previous HTTP subset had Beta evidence from independent
otel-cli and telemetrygen; both now also exercise gRPC. No pcap oracle or fuzz target exists.
No profiles, receiver TLS/mTLS, persistent ingestion, forwarding or third-party JSON sender
evidence is claimed. See tests/server/otlp/AGENTS.md and tests/client/otlp/AGENTS.md.
