# IRC Protocol Implementation

## Overview

IRC (Internet Relay Chat) server implementing core IRC protocol for real-time text-based communication. The LLM controls
IRC responses, handles protocol commands (NICK, USER, JOIN, PRIVMSG, PING, etc.), and manages chat server logic.

**Status**: Experimental (see `metadata()` in `actions.rs` - that is the authoritative value)
**RFC**: RFC 1459 (Internet Relay Chat Protocol), RFC 2812 (IRC Client Protocol)
**Port**: 6667 (plain TCP), 6697 (with TLS, not implemented)

## Library Choices

- **No IRC library** - Manual protocol implementation
    - IRC is line-based text protocol (simple parsing)
    - Commands parsed from text lines
    - Responses constructed as formatted strings
    - No complex binary protocol
- **tokio** - Async runtime and I/O
    - `TcpListener` for accepting connections
    - `BufReader`, read through `wire::read_irc_line` rather than `read_line` (see below)
    - `AsyncWriteExt` for sending responses

**Rationale**: IRC protocol is simple enough that no dedicated library is needed. Messages are text lines ending with
`\r\n`, commands are space-separated tokens. Manual implementation gives LLM full control and avoids library
constraints.

## Architecture Decisions

### 1. Action-Based LLM Control

The LLM receives raw IRC messages and responds with structured actions:

- `send_irc_message` - Send raw IRC message
- `send_irc_welcome` - Send 001 RPL_WELCOME numeric
- `send_irc_pong` - Respond to PING with PONG
- `send_irc_join` - Send JOIN confirmation
- `send_irc_part` - Send PART confirmation
- `send_irc_privmsg` - Send PRIVMSG (chat message)
- `send_irc_notice` - Send NOTICE (notification)
- `send_irc_numeric` - Send numeric response (e.g., 332 for topic)
- `wait_for_more` - Buffer more data before responding
- `close_connection` - Close client connection

### 2. Line-Based Message Processing

IRC message flow:

1. Accept TCP connection
2. Read one line with `wire::read_irc_line`, **bounded** at `MAX_IRC_READ_LINE` (8704 bytes)
3. Parse IRC command from line (e.g., "NICK alice\r\n")
4. Send line to LLM as `irc_message_received` event
5. LLM returns actions (e.g., `send_irc_welcome`)
6. Execute actions (send responses)
7. Loop for next line

### 3. Line framing is enforced, not assumed (`src/server/irc/wire.rs`)

IRC is line-oriented in both directions, and both directions are attacker-influenced: the peer
chooses what it sends, and the **model** chooses the text we relay to other humans in a channel.
`wire.rs` is the one place that decides what a line may be, and the IRC *client* shares it.

**Inbound: the read is bounded.** `AsyncBufReadExt::read_line` grows its buffer until it finds a
newline, so a peer that connects and streams bytes with no `\n` is a one-connection
out-of-memory - unauthenticated, since IRC has no authentication before NICK/USER. The read now
goes through `wire::read_irc_line`, capped at `MAX_IRC_READ_LINE` = 8704 bytes (RFC 1459's 512
plus IRCv3's 8191 bytes of message tags, so nothing real is refused). A peer that exceeds it
gets `ERROR :Closing link: message exceeds 8704 bytes` and the link is closed - there is no
resynchronisation point once the prefix has been thrown away.

**Outbound: model text cannot forge a second message.** Every `send_irc_*` action interpolates
model-supplied strings into a CRLF-terminated line, so a `message` containing `\r\n` did not
produce a longer message - it produced *two*, the second attributed to this server. This is the
same defect as FTP's reply splitting (`src/server/ftp/actions.rs`), and it is worse here because
the payload is chat. Three rules now apply, all in `wire.rs` and all erroring rather than
silently rewriting (a handler that meant two messages should emit two actions):

- `reject_line_breaks` - no CR, LF or NUL in any interpolated field. RFC 1459 §2.3.1 forbids all
  three in a message.
- `reject_not_a_word` - fields that land in *word* position (`nickname`, `channel`, `target`,
  `source`, `server`, `user`, `host`) additionally reject spaces, a leading `:` and emptiness,
  each of which shifts every parameter after it. Trailing parameters (a message body, a PART
  reason) get `reject_line_breaks` only, because spaces are exactly what belongs there.
- `cap_line` - the finished line is truncated to RFC 1459's 512 bytes including CRLF, on a
  `char` boundary, with a WARN naming the action. Truncation rather than refusal, because that
  is what a real ircd does and because dropping a chat message entirely is the worse answer.

`send_irc_numeric` additionally rejects a code outside 1..=999: `{:03}` pads a smaller number
but widens a larger one, and a four-digit "numeric" is read by the client as the start of the
next parameter.

Sent messages still get their `\r\n` added automatically; what changed is that the text may no
longer contain one of its own.

Tested by `tests/server/irc/framing_test.rs` (zero LLM calls), which asserts each refusal, the
512-byte cut on multi-byte text, and - on a real socket - that 64 KiB with no newline is cut off
with `ERROR` rather than buffered.

### 4. No Server-Side State

`IrcProtocol` is a unit struct. It previously carried an `IrcClientState` map (nickname,
username, realname, channels) with insert/update/lookup helpers, but nothing ever called any of
them - no nickname was recorded and no channel was joined - so it was removed. Protocols do not
keep protocol state in Rust; the model tracks nicknames and channel membership through its
instruction and server memory.

### 4a. Log Previews Must Be Char-Safe

Both message previews in `mod.rs` go through `crate::utils::truncate_for_log`. They used to be
`&line[..100]`, which panics whenever byte 100 of an IRC line falls inside a multi-byte
character - i.e. on ordinary non-ASCII chat text. A panic in a connection task is silent and
leaves the server reporting `Running`.

### 5. Dual Logging

- **DEBUG**: Message summary with 100-char preview ("IRC received 15 bytes: NICK alice")
- **TRACE**: Full text message ("IRC data (text): \"NICK alice\\r\\n\"")
- Both go to netget.log and TUI Status panel

### 6. Connection Management

Each IRC client gets:

- Unique `ConnectionId`
- Entry in `ServerInstance.connections` with `ProtocolConnectionInfo::empty()` (IRC stores no
  protocol-specific connection info)
- Tracked bytes sent/received, packets sent/received
- State: Active until client disconnects or LLM closes

## LLM Integration

### Event Type

**`irc_message_received`** - Triggered when IRC client sends a message. This is the only event
IRC emits, and its `.with_actions(...)` list is what `call_llm` offers the model - it carries
the full action set below.

Event parameters:

- `message` (string) - The IRC message line received, **CRLF stripped** (`line.trim()`)

### Available Actions

See `actions.rs` for complete action list including `send_irc_part`, `send_irc_notice`, etc.

## Connection Management

### Connection Lifecycle

1. **Accept**: TCP listener accepts connection
2. **Register**: Connection added to `ServerInstance` with `ProtocolConnectionInfo::empty()`
3. **Split**: Stream split into ReadHalf and WriteHalf
4. **Track**: WriteHalf stored in `Arc<Mutex<WriteHalf>>` for sending
5. **Read Loop**: Continuous line reading until disconnect
6. **Close**: Connection removed when client closes or LLM sends `close_connection`

### Dashboard injection (`[ message this peer ]` / `[ disconnect this peer ]`)

Every connection registers a peer handle (`server::peer_support`) right after it is tracked
and *before* the first read - IRC does not speak first, so a manual `*` rule parking the
registration exchange still leaves the operator able to reach the connection.
`AppState::send_to_peer` runs the action through the same executor as the LLM path; every wire
verb here returns `ActionResult::Output` and `close_connection` half-closes, so there is no
`Custom` gap. `update_connection_stats` is called on every read line and every write (model
output and the numeric-400 failure reply alike), so the rail's `↓ ↑` counters and
`last_activity` are live. The handle is removed on every exit path (EOF, read error,
`close_connection`, backend-unavailable `ERROR`) through the single cleanup after the read
loop. Test: `tests/server/irc/peer_inject_test.rs` (zero LLM calls).

### State Management

- **No per-connection state machine.** Unlike TCP, IRC does not implement
  Idle/Processing/Accumulating and has no `queued_data`: the read loop awaits each LLM call
  before reading the next line, so lines are handled strictly in order and a slow model applies
  backpressure through TCP rather than being queued.
- Connection stays in ServerInstance until closed
- No startup parameters. `send_first` was declared and then discarded; an IRC server does not
  speak first, so it is no longer declared and passing it now produces a warning.

## Known Limitations

### 1. No Channel State Management

- Server doesn't track which users are in which channels
- No channel topic storage
- No user lists per channel
- LLM must track channel state in conversation context

**Workaround**: LLM can maintain pseudo-state through prompts and memory.

### 2. No User Authentication

- No password checking
- No SASL support
- No NickServ integration
- All users accepted
- **No ident lookup.** A real ircd opens a connection back to the client's port 113 (RFC 1413)
  on accept and prefixes the resulting username with `~` when the lookup fails. NetGet does
  neither: it never contacts the peer's ident service, and the `user` field of a JOIN/PART
  prefix is whatever the model supplies (default `"user"`), not anything verified. NetGet does
  ship an `ident` protocol, but it is a separate server - nothing wires the two together, and a
  client that expects the connect-time ident probe will not see one.

### 3. Limited Numeric Responses

- Only generic `send_irc_numeric` action
- No dedicated actions for common numerics (353 NAMES, 366 ENDOFNAMES, etc.)
- LLM must know numeric codes

**Future Enhancement**: Add dedicated actions for common numerics.

### 4. No Server-to-Server Protocol

- Single-server only
- No IRC network support
- No server linking

### 5. No TLS Support

- Plain TCP only (port 6667)
- No SSL/TLS encryption (port 6697)
- See DoT/DoH for encrypted alternatives

**Workaround**: Use reverse proxy (e.g., nginx) for TLS termination.

### 6. No Operator Commands

- No /OPER command
- No /KILL, /KICK, /BAN commands
- No channel modes (+o, +v, etc.)

### 7. No CTCP Support

- No CTCP ACTION (/me)
- No CTCP VERSION, PING, TIME
- CTCP messages treated as regular PRIVMSG

## Example Prompts

### Basic IRC Server

```
listen on port 6667 via irc
When users send NICK and USER commands, send IRC welcome (001)
When users send PING, respond with PONG
When users send JOIN #channel, confirm with JOIN message
```

### Echo Bot

```
listen on port 6667 via irc
Respond to all PRIVMSG with an echo: "You said: <message>"
Ignore NICK, USER, and PING commands (send appropriate responses)
```

### Channel Server

```
listen on port 6667 via irc
Support channels: #general, #random, #dev
When users JOIN a channel, send JOIN confirmation and channel topic (332)
When users send PRIVMSG to channel, echo to all users (simulate broadcast)
```

### Interactive Bot

```
listen on port 6667 via irc
Act as a helpful chatbot named "NetBot"
Respond to PRIVMSG with relevant information
Support commands: !help, !time, !joke
Send welcome message when users connect
```

## Performance Characteristics

### Latency

- **Per Message (with scripting)**: Sub-millisecond
- **Per Message (without scripting)**: 2-5 seconds (LLM call)
- Line parsing: <1 microsecond
- Message formatting: <1 microsecond

### Throughput

- **With Scripting**: Thousands of messages per second
- **Without Scripting**: ~0.2-0.5 messages per second (LLM-limited)
- Concurrent connections: Unlimited (bounded by system resources)
- Each connection processes independently

### Scripting Compatibility

Good scripting candidate:

- Text-based protocol (easy to parse and generate)
- Repetitive command/response patterns
- State can be maintained in script
- High message volume typical for chat
