// SMB carries file *contents*, which are routinely not text. Both directions
// therefore carry an explicit `encoding` field next to the payload string, and
// there is deliberately no sniffing: "SGVsbG8=" is simultaneously valid text and
// valid base64, and only the sender knows which it means. This is the same shape
// as `send_tcp_data`'s `encoding` field (d70bb5b5); the defect fixed here was
// that `smb_read_file.content` was documented as "base64 encoded for binary"
// while the executor did `.as_bytes()`, so a model that followed the
// documentation put literal base64 ASCII into the file.
