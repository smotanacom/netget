//! SMB/CIFS server implementation
//!
//! Provides an SMB2 file server where the LLM controls the virtual filesystem. Sessions are
//! guest or anonymous: the NTLMSSP exchange is walked so a real client finishes SESSION_SETUP,
//! but no password is checked (see `auth.rs`).
//!
//! `wire.rs` owns every byte layout; this file owns the connection, the per-connection state
//! and the model.
