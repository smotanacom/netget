/// HTTP is client-speaks-first: the request line is the first thing on the wire and every
/// registry client sends it inside its dial path, so a peer that has connected and sent no byte
/// has begun no request. Thirty seconds sits between nginx's `client_header_timeout` default of
/// 60s and Apache's `RequestReadTimeout header=20`, both of which bound the same thing.
///
/// Enforced with `TcpStream::peek` **before** hyper sees the socket. hyper owns every read once
/// `serve_connection` starts, and a deadline on its reads would be wrong here rather than merely
/// awkward: hyper keeps polling the connection for new frames while a request is being answered,
/// so such a deadline would fire in the middle of an LLM round-trip. `peek` waits for data
/// without consuming it, so the request line is still there for hyper afterwards.

/// default) - and `watch_idle` reports a busy connection as not idle at all, so the clock only
/// ever runs on a connection with nothing in flight.
///
/// Five minutes, because that is npm's own `fetch-timeout` default (300000 ms, confirmed with
/// `npm config get fetch-timeout`): the client itself gives up on a server that has said nothing
/// for this long, so closing a connection that has been silent for as long can never be the side
/// that breaks a working `npm install`. Closing an idle persistent connection is ordinary HTTP -
/// RFC 9112 requires a client to cope with it, which is why nginx ships `keepalive_timeout 75s`,
