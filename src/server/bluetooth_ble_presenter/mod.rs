//! BLE Presenter Service — a presentation clicker over HID-over-GATT.
//!
//! A thin profile wrapper over the `bluetooth-ble` base stack: the base owns the radio, the
//! GATT table, the event loop and the LLM plumbing. What lives here is the *profile identity* —
//! the instruction preamble, and the HID report descriptor plus report layout the startup
//! examples in `actions.rs` publish.
//!
//! Those two constants are the single source of truth for the report map. Nothing inside
//! NetGet parses a report descriptor — the base stack carries it as an opaque byte string and
//! hands it to whichever central asks — so the first parser ever to see one is a host's HID
//! stack on someone else's machine. Keeping the bytes in one place, hex-encoded into the
//! examples rather than transcribed, is the only thing standing between a typo and a device
//! the host rejects.
