//! MySQL server implementation using opensrv-mysql
//!
//! **Inbound packets are bounded before they are buffered.** `opensrv-mysql` has no
//! maximum-packet check of any kind, and it is the crate that answers
//! `SELECT @@max_allowed_packet` with 67108864 — so until now this server published a ceiling
//! and enforced nothing, on an unauthenticated connection, before any model call.
//! `packet_limit` puts that number where the bytes are: see [`packet_limit::MAX_PACKET_BYTES`].
