# DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH) Protocol Implementation

## Overview

DNS-over-HTTPS server implementing RFC 8484 for secure DNS queries over HTTPS transport. The LLM controls DNS responses
while NetGet handles HTTPS server operations, TLS encryption, and HTTP/2 protocol.

**Status**: Beta (Core Protocol)
**RFC**: RFC 8484 (DNS Queries over HTTPS), RFC 1035 (DNS), RFC 7540 (HTTP/2)
**Port**: 443 (HTTPS, typically), declared as `PrivilegeRequirement::PrivilegedPort(443)`

### What "Beta" covers here

DoH contributes the HTTPS/HTTP2 transport and the RFC 8484 request encodings;
every DNS semantic - the action set, action execution, response construction -
is the DNS protocol's, reached through delegation (see below). Both the GET
(base64url `?dns=`) and POST (`application/dns-message` body) paths are
exercised by `tests/server/doh/e2e_test.rs` against **reqwest** (hyper + rustls under the hood).
Not covered: HTTP/1.1, CA-signed or custom certificates, rate limiting, caching,
EDNS0.

### ALPN

The listener advertises **`h2`**, via
`tls_cert_manager::generate_default_tls_config_with_alpn(&["h2"])` rather than the shared
`generate_default_tls_config()` — `dot`, `tls` and `quic` are built from that default and
document themselves as ALPN-less, so it must stay that way for them.

It advertised nothing until August 2026, and this server speaks only HTTP/2. A client that
negotiates normally therefore had no way to learn the protocol: it fell back to HTTP/1.1 and
hyper's `http2::Builder` rejected the connection with "http2 error", or it refused outright.

**The E2E test could not have caught this**, because `create_insecure_client()` uses
`http2_prior_knowledge()`, which asserts HTTP/2 out of band and skips ALPN entirely. Dropping
that option does not fix the coverage either: under `danger_accept_invalid_certs` reqwest builds
its own rustls `ClientConfig` that does not offer `h2`, so it simply sends HTTP/1.1 and fails.
`server_advertises_h2_alpn` covers the property directly instead, and also asserts the shared
default is still ALPN-less so this cannot be "fixed" by changing it under the other three.

Still unproven end to end: that a client which negotiates via ALPN completes a real DoH query.
That needs a client which offers `h2` while trusting a self-signed certificate.

## Library Choices

- **hickory-proto** (formerly trust-dns) - DNS protocol parsing and construction
    - Reuses DNS wire format handling from standard DNS implementation
    - Parses queries and constructs responses
    - Handles all DNS record types (A, AAAA, MX, TXT, CNAME, etc.)
- **hyper** - HTTP/2 server implementation
    - Async HTTP server with HTTP/2 support
    - Handles request routing and response generation
    - Service-based architecture for request handling
- **tokio-rustls** - Async TLS server implementation
    - Provides TLS acceptor for TCP streams
    - Uses rustls for TLS protocol
    - Self-signed certificates generated automatically
- **base64** - Base64url encoding/decoding
    - Required for GET method (DNS query in URL parameter)
    - URL-safe encoding without padding

**Rationale**: DoH is DNS delivered over HTTP/2 with TLS. By combining hickory-proto (DNS), hyper (HTTP/2), and
tokio-rustls (TLS), we get a complete secure DNS over HTTPS solution. The LLM focuses on DNS semantics while libraries
handle HTTP and encryption.

## Architecture Decisions

### 1. Delegation to DNS Protocol

DoH defines **no actions of its own**. `DohProtocol` wraps a `DnsProtocol` and
forwards everything DNS-shaped to it:

- `get_sync_actions()` / `get_async_actions()` return the DNS action definitions
  verbatim
- `execute_action()` forwards to `DnsProtocol::execute_action`
- `DOH_QUERY_EVENT` is built by calling `DnsProtocol::get_sync_actions()` and
  attaching that list to the event

The only thing DoH owns is the event type (`doh_query`, one event, carrying
extra `peer_addr` and `method` fields) and the transport. So "DoH has zero
actions defined in `src/server/doh/actions.rs`" is true as a grep result and
misleading as a statement about capability: the LLM sees the full DNS action set
on every `doh_query`, and this delegation is what keeps DNS, DoT and DoH
answering identically.

### 2. HTTP/2 Transport Layer

Connection flow:

1. Accept TCP connection on port 443
2. Perform TLS handshake using self-signed certificate
3. Establish HTTP/2 connection over TLS
4. Handle HTTP requests (GET or POST) to `/dns-query` endpoint
5. Extract DNS query from request (URL param or body)
6. Parse DNS query with hickory-proto
7. Send to LLM for response
8. Return DNS response as HTTP body with `application/dns-message` content-type

### 3. Two HTTP Methods Supported

#### GET Method (RFC 8484 Section 4.1)

- DNS query encoded as base64url in `dns=` query parameter
- Example: `GET /dns-query?dns=AAABAAABAAAAAAAAA3d3dwdleGFtcGxlA2NvbQAAAQAB`
- URL-safe base64 encoding (no padding)
- Lightweight, can be cached by HTTP proxies
- Used by web browsers via `<link>` tags

#### POST Method (RFC 8484 Section 4.1)

- DNS query sent as request body
- Content-Type: `application/dns-message`, matched per RFC 9110 §8.3 -
  case-insensitively, and ignoring any parameters after `;`. It used to be a
  byte-for-byte `!=` against the canonical spelling, so `Application/DNS-Message`
  and `application/dns-message; charset=utf-8` were both rejected as "Invalid
  Content-Type": a conformant client turned away for being conformant
- Binary DNS packet (not encoded)
- More efficient for large queries
- Used by DoH client libraries

### 4. Self-Signed Certificates

TLS configuration:

- Certificates generated by `tls_cert_manager::generate_default_tls_config()`
- Self-signed for testing/development
- Clients must disable certificate verification for testing
- Production usage requires proper CA-signed certificates

### 5. Dual Logging

- **DEBUG**: Query summary ("DoH query: example.com A via GET"), HTTP method, byte counts
- **TRACE**: Full hex dumps of DNS packets (both request and response)
- Both go to netget.log and TUI Status panel

### 6. HTTP/2 Connection Management

Unlike DoT (raw TLS) and UDP DNS:

- HTTP/2 allows multiplexed requests over single connection
- Connection pooling handled by hyper
- Each request is independent (RESTful API)
- No persistent state between requests

## LLM Integration

### Event Type

**`doh_query`** - Triggered when DNS query received over HTTPS

Event parameters:

- `query_id` (number) - DNS transaction ID from request packet
- `domain` (string) - Domain name being queried
- `query_type` (string) - Record type (A, AAAA, MX, TXT, etc.), rendered with
  `Display` rather than `{:?}` for the same reason DoT's is
- `peer_addr` (string) - Client IP address and port
- `method` (string) - HTTP method used (GET or POST)

### Available Actions

DoH reuses all DNS actions, and only those:

- `send_dns_a_response` - Return IPv4 address (A record)
- `send_dns_aaaa_response` - Return IPv6 address (AAAA record)
- `send_dns_mx_response` - Return mail exchange record
- `send_dns_txt_response` - Return text record
- `send_dns_cname_response` - Return canonical name alias
- `send_dns_nxdomain` - Domain does not exist
- `send_dns_response` - Hand-assembled response, hex-encoded (escape hatch)
- `ignore_query` - Answered as HTTP 404 rather than by dropping the request,
  since HTTP requires a response

See `src/server/dns/CLAUDE.md` for detailed action documentation.

`dns_response` was previously listed here; no such action exists - the real name
is `send_dns_response`.

As with plain DNS, a **static** event handler cannot serve DoH answers: it
cannot echo the client's random transaction ID or the queried name. Use script
mode for deterministic answers; static mode is only useful for `ignore_query`.

### Example LLM Response

```json
{
  "actions": [
    {
      "type": "send_dns_a_response",
      "query_id": 12345,
      "domain": "example.com",
      "ip": "93.184.216.34",
      "ttl": 300
    },
    {
      "type": "show_message",
      "message": "Resolved example.com to 93.184.216.34 over HTTPS"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Connection Management

### Startup

`DohServer::spawn` binds the `TcpListener` **before** spawning the accept loop
and returns the bound `SocketAddr`. That ordering matters: if the bind were done
inside the spawned task, a port conflict or permission error would be swallowed
by the background task while `open_server` reported the server as `Running`, and
a caller that asked for port 0 would be told the port was 0. The accept loop's
`JoinHandle` is registered with `AppState::register_server_task` so
`stop_server` can abort it and release the port.

### Connection Lifecycle

1. **Accept**: TCP listener accepts connection on port 443
2. **TLS Handshake**: `TlsAcceptor::accept()` performs TLS negotiation
3. **HTTP/2 Setup**: hyper establishes HTTP/2 connection
4. **Request Loop**: Handle multiple HTTP requests over same connection. A
   `ConnectionId` is allocated and a `ConnectionState` added to
   `ServerInstance.connections` *before* the TLS handshake, `update_connection_stats`
   is called for every query in and answer out, and `close_connection_on_server`
   runs however the connection ends. None of this existed before September 2026:
   DoH drew an empty peer list however many clients were talking to it, and
   `{client_ip}` in the `doh_query` template rendered empty because `call_llm` was
   passed `None` for the connection
5. **Close**: Connection ends when client closes or error occurs

### State Management

- DoH connections are stateless at application level (REST API)
- HTTP/2 manages connection multiplexing
- Each request is independent (no state between requests)
- No connection state stored in ServerInstance

## Known Limitations

### 1. Self-Signed Certificates Only

- No support for custom certificates
- No CA-signed certificate loading
- No certificate rotation/renewal
- Testing requires disabling certificate verification on clients

**Workaround**: For production, modify `tls_cert_manager` to load custom certificates.

### 2. No Path Routing At All

The request path is never examined. `/dns-query` is the conventional RFC 8484
endpoint and is what clients will use, but any path - `/`, `/foo` - is served
identically, and there is no way to configure or reject one. This is lenient
rather than broken (RFC 8484 treats the path as discovered from a URI template,
not fixed), but it does mean the server cannot host anything else alongside DoH.

### 3. No HTTP/1.1 Support

- Only HTTP/2 supported
- HTTP/1.1 DoH clients will fail
- Fallback not implemented

**Reason**: RFC 8484 recommends HTTP/2 for performance (multiplexing).

### 4. DNS Limitations Inherited

All limitations from standard DNS protocol apply:

- Single answer per action (use `send_dns_response` for multiple)
- Limited record type support
- No DNSSEC
- No recursive resolution
- See `src/server/dns/CLAUDE.md` for full list

### 5. No Rate Limiting

- No per-client request limits
- No connection limits
- Vulnerable to DoS attacks without external rate limiting

Two unbounded resources were closed in September 2026, and they were worse than
"no rate limiting":

- **The request body was read with `req.collect()`, which has no cap.** Over an
  established HTTP/2 connection a peer could POST gigabytes to `/dns-query` and
  NetGet buffered all of it before deciding it was not a DNS message. It is now
  read through `http_body_util::Limited` at `MAX_DOH_BODY_BYTES` (65535 - a DNS
  message cannot be larger) and anything over gets `413`.
- **The TLS handshake had no timeout**, so connecting and then saying nothing held
  a task open forever. Bounded at 10s.

Per-connection tasks are also registered with `AppState::register_server_task` now,
so `stop_server` aborts them; unregistered, they outlived the server.

### 6. No Caching

- No HTTP cache headers
- No query result caching
- Each request hits LLM or script

**Future Enhancement**: Add cache-control headers based on DNS TTL.

## Failure behaviour: SERVFAIL in a 200, not a 5xx

When `call_llm` returns `Err`, the query is answered with a **DNS SERVFAIL message**
carried in a `200 application/dns-message` - the same answer plain DNS and DoT put on
the wire, built by the same `dns::actions::build_servfail`, so the transaction id and
question section are echoed and the client accepts it.

RFC 8484 §4.2.1 makes 200 the status for "this HTTP transaction carried a DNS
message"; whether that message is an answer or a failure is DNS's business. This used
to return `500 "LLM error"`, which tells a DoH client the *resolver endpoint* is
broken and makes real clients mark the server down and fail over - a much heavier
reaction than the transient backend hiccup that caused it.

The HTTP-level failure is reserved for the case where no DNS message can be built at
all: `503` + `Retry-After` for `WireFailure::Overloaded`, `500` for `Unavailable`,
carrying the category text and never the error itself. Which of the two applied is
recorded in the log as `decision=fail_closed_llm_overload` /
`decision=fail_closed_llm_error`, the way `src/server/radius/` does it, because
SERVFAIL is the same bytes whatever went wrong.

## Example Prompts

### Basic DoH Server

```
listen on port 443 via dns-over-https
Respond to all A record queries for example.com with IP 93.184.216.34
For all other domains, return NXDOMAIN
```

### Multi-Method DoH Server

```
listen on port 443 via doh
Support both GET and POST methods for DNS queries
For secure.example.com:
  - A record: 93.184.216.34
  - AAAA record: 2001:db8::1
For unknown domains, return NXDOMAIN
```

### Privacy-Focused DoH

```
listen on port 443 via dns-over-https
Provide DNS resolution over HTTPS for privacy
Block tracking domains by returning NXDOMAIN for:
  - doubleclick.net
  - google-analytics.com
For legitimate domains, resolve normally
```

## Performance Characteristics

### Latency

- **TLS Handshake**: ~50-100ms (one-time per connection)
- **HTTP/2 Setup**: ~10ms (one-time per connection)
- **Per Query (with scripting)**: 1-2ms (after connection setup)
- **Per Query (without scripting)**: 2-5 seconds (LLM call)
- hickory-proto parsing: ~10-50 microseconds
- Base64 decode (GET): ~1-5 microseconds

### Throughput

- **With Scripting**: Thousands of queries per second
- **Without Scripting**: ~0.2-0.5 QPS (LLM-limited)
- HTTP/2 multiplexing enables concurrent requests
- Connection reuse amortizes TLS/HTTP/2 setup

### Method Comparison

- **GET**: Slightly slower (base64 decode), but cacheable by proxies
- **POST**: Slightly faster (no encoding), better for large queries
- Performance difference negligible in practice

### Comparison to DoT and UDP DNS

- **vs DoT**: Similar performance, but HTTP/2 multiplexing better for concurrent queries
- **vs UDP DNS**: Higher latency (TLS+HTTP overhead), but encrypted and tamper-proof
- **Use Case**: Web browsers, privacy-focused DNS clients, corporate environments

### Scripting Compatibility

Excellent scripting candidate:

- Same query/response pattern as DNS/DoT
- Deterministic responses based on domain
- HTTP/2 makes scripting very efficient
- High query volume typical

## Security Considerations

### TLS + HTTP/2 Protection

- Prevents eavesdropping on DNS queries
- Prevents DNS spoofing/tampering
- Ensures query integrity
- Authenticates server (with proper certificates)
- HTTP/2 encryption provides additional layer

### Self-Signed Certificate Risks

- Default setup vulnerable to MITM attacks
- Clients must explicitly trust self-signed cert
- Not suitable for production without proper PKI

### Privacy Benefits

- ISP/network operators cannot see DNS queries
- Prevents DNS-based tracking
- Protects against DNS hijacking
- Indistinguishable from HTTPS traffic (bypasses censorship)
- Complements HTTPS for end-to-end privacy

### HTTP GET Method Considerations

- GET requests can be logged by proxies
- DNS query visible in proxy logs (base64 encoded)
- POST method preferred for sensitive queries

## `test_doh_server`: a literal IP still goes through the system resolver (August 2026)

`test_doh_server` failed roughly **4 runs in 6** of the full suite at `--test-threads=100`,
always the same way: `reqwest ... source: TimedOut` on the first GET, against a DoH server that
had logged `DoH server listening on 127.0.0.1:<port>` and had never been asked anything — the
mock reported zero `doh_query` calls.

**Cause: `reqwest` resolves the URL host unconditionally, even when it is a dotted quad.**
`hyper-util`'s default `GaiResolver` does not special-case `127.0.0.1`, so every request made a
`getaddrinfo("127.0.0.1")` call. On macOS that goes through libinfo to mDNSResponder — one
system-wide daemon — and at 100 test threads about a hundred processes ask it simultaneously.

The measurement that pinned it, after the timing was instrumented directly:

```
!!!T!!! client built after 1.047375ms
!!!T!!! raw TCP connect took 464µs ok=true          <- same runtime, same port, immediately before
!!!T!!! GET FAILED after 10.001948584s: ... TimedOut
[STDERR] ... DoH TCP connection from 127.0.0.1:59561   <- the raw probe
[STDERR] ... DoH TCP connection from 127.0.0.1:62223   <- reqwest, 8.25s later
```

A raw `TcpStream::connect` from the same test, on the same runtime, in the same moment, reached
the server in 464µs. reqwest's connect had not reached it 8 seconds later. The machine, the
runtime, the accept loop and the TLS stack were all healthy; only the name lookup was stuck.

**Fix:** `.resolve("127.0.0.1", <addr>)` on the client builder, which bypasses the system
resolver. That took the test from 4/6 failures to **0/8** at the same machine load
(load average ~120 on 12 cores).

### What this replaces, and why the earlier reading was wrong

An earlier pass concluded the evidence "points at external machine load" and listed four ruled-out
hypotheses. Load was real and was what made the bug *visible*, but it was not the cause, and
treating it as one nearly cost the fix. Two of the earlier candidates were also tested properly
here and are genuinely not needed: a multi-threaded test runtime and building the client on
`spawn_blocking` each changed nothing once the resolver was overridden (the client builds in
~1ms), so neither was kept.

The lesson is the method rather than the finding: **when a client times out against a healthy
server, prove which step is stuck before blaming the environment.** One raw `TcpStream::connect`
next to the failing request separated "the machine cannot connect" from "this library will not
connect", and that single line is what turned an unexplained flake into a one-line fix.

**Every other e2e test that points `reqwest` at `127.0.0.1` had the same latent defect** — all
18 now carry the override. So does NetGet itself, for any endpoint configured with an IP
(`src/llm/ollama_client.rs::without_dns_for_literal_ip`); that second fix is what stopped the
`bluetooth_ble` read tests failing, whose `/api/tags` probe was spending its entire 5-second
budget in the resolver.

### The residual, and what was measured

After both fixes, `test_doh_server` still timed out about 2 runs in 6 at load ~150. reqwest now
connects in ~30ms and it is the **TLS handshake** that does not complete inside the remaining
budget. Two candidate remedies were tested rather than assumed, and the result is worth
recording because one of them is the opposite of the intuition:

| change | failures |
|---|---|
| baseline (before either DNS fix) | 4 / 6 |
| DNS fixes only | 2 / 6 |
| **+ `multi_thread` test runtime and batched harness output** | **7 / 8 — much worse** |
| + request budget raised 10s → 30s | **0 / 8** at load 161 |

Giving the test its own 4 worker threads makes it *worse*, because `--test-threads=100` already
oversubscribes a 12-core box and four workers per test multiplies the contention. That is the
reverse of what "starved runtime → add threads" suggests, and it is why the earlier pass was
right to drop it — though for the wrong reason.

The 10s budget was the only tight deadline in the file (its siblings wait 20s and 30s) and it
bounds a two-process TLS + HTTP/2 handshake, not server health. It is now 30s. **That change
was made last, deliberately.** Raising it first would have hidden both real defects, which is
exactly what nearly happened when an earlier pass concluded the cause was "machine load".
