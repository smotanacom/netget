/// disconnect half-closes the socket and marks the row closed, which a peer that is not
/// reading never notices — so without a deadline on the *header* read this task stayed parked
/// in `read_exact` until the peer itself closed, holding the connection's tasks and state row
/// behind an operator action that reported success. [`BODY_READ_TIMEOUT`] did not cover it:
/// that one arms only once sixteen bytes have already arrived.
///
/// Like every read deadline in this tree it is armed lazily, per read: the future is created
/// at the top of the loop, *after* the previous message's LLM round-trip (or a `manual` rule
/// parked for a human, 300 s by default) has finished, so no clock runs during that work and a
/// long park cannot evict a live session. That is the TFTP eviction defect stated in reverse.

/// bound is ten minutes, so without a cap a peer connecting once a second pins six hundred
/// sockets before the first is even eligible to close.
///
/// A MongoDB connection is a pooled *session*, not a request — a driver opens
/// `maxPoolSize` (100 by default) per client and keeps them — so this server's live-connection
/// count is its client population times that pool, and the house default sits deliberately
/// above two such clients. The per-connection memory is bounded separately by

/// unusable here for the reason `ipp` and `ident` are silent: **every reply is addressed to a
/// request that a refused peer has not sent.** A wire message's header carries `responseTo`,
/// which the driver matches against its outstanding `requestID`; nothing has arrived at the
/// accept, so the only value available is zero.
///
/// That is worse than silence rather than merely useless. A driver that receives a reply it
/// did not ask for does not surface it as an error — it has no request to fail — so an
/// invented OP_MSG is discarded while the driver goes on waiting for the `hello` it did send,
/// and the peer we meant to turn away instead blocks until its own `connectTimeoutMS`. An EOF
/// during the handshake is a case every driver already has: the connection is marked failed
/// immediately, the pool retries elsewhere, and SDAM records a transient network error rather
/// than a protocol one.
