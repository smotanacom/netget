//! OpenVPN control channel: events and actions.
//!
//! The server owns the wire format, the reliability layer, the TLS session and
//! the key-method-2 encoding; the model owns the two policy decisions in the
//! handshake, and both are enforced:
//!
//! 1. **`openvpn_peer_reset`** — answer the session reset, or stay silent.
//!    `accept_peer` is the only thing that causes a
//!    `P_CONTROL_HARD_RESET_SERVER_V2` to be sent.
//! 2. **`openvpn_client_key_exchange`** — the client has completed the TLS
//!    handshake and sent its options string and `--auth-user-pass` credentials.
//!    `accept_key_exchange` is the only thing that causes the server's own key
//!    method 2 message to be sent.
//!
//! For both, `reject_*`, an empty answer, and an LLM error all leave the peer
//! with nothing, under distinct `decision=` tokens in the log.
//!
//! Nothing here promises a tunnel, because this server cannot build one: it
//! answers no `PUSH_REQUEST`, derives no data channel keys and has no TUN
//! device. See `src/server/openvpn/mod.rs`.
