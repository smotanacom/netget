# Gearman Job Server Implementation

Gearman job server (gearmand 1.1's protocol). The model is the worker for every function:
a client submits a job, NetGet answers `JOB_CREATED` with its own handle, and the model's answer
becomes the job's progress, partial output and outcome. NetGet writes every byte of framing.

**State**: Beta (see Maturity). **Privilege**: `None` — the well-known port is 4730.
**Stack**: `ETH>IP>TCP>Gearman`. **Feature**: `gearman` (no dependencies).

## Library choice

None. The binary protocol is a 12-byte header and NUL-separated arguments, the admin protocol
is lines; `wire.rs` is pure functions. No maintained Rust crate implements the server side.

## Files

| File | What it holds |
|---|---|
| `mod.rs` | accept loop, the in-flight job table (`Jobs`), the session loop, `run_job` (the model's answer → packets), `Framer` (packets and admin lines on one connection) |
| `wire.rs` | `parse_header`, `encode`/`response`, `split_args`, `parse_request`, the packet renderers, `read_response`, `error`, the admin parser and renderers |
| `actions.rs` | the `Protocol`/`Server` impls, the seven actions, `Work`, the `gearman_job_submitted` event |

## Spec subset

A leading `\0` byte says a binary packet follows; anything else is an admin line. One
connection may mix them.

| Request | Answered by | Response |
|---|---|---|
| `SUBMIT_JOB`, `_HIGH`, `_LOW` | NetGet, then the model → `gearman_job_submitted {function, unique_id, workload, workload_bytes, priority, background: false, job_handle}` | `JOB_CREATED`, then `WORK_STATUS`/`WORK_DATA`… and exactly one of `WORK_COMPLETE`, `WORK_FAIL`, `WORK_EXCEPTION`, `ERROR` |
| `SUBMIT_JOB_BG`, `_HIGH_BG`, `_LOW_BG` | the same, `background: true` | `JOB_CREATED` only; the model's answer is logged |
| `GET_STATUS` | NetGet, from the jobs in flight | `STATUS_RES handle known running num den` (`0 0 0 0` once a job is answered) |
| `ECHO_REQ` | NetGet | `ECHO_RES` with the same data |
| `OPTION_REQ exceptions` | NetGet | `OPTION_RES`; the connection then receives `WORK_EXCEPTION` as such |
| `OPTION_REQ` anything else | NetGet | `ERROR unknown_option` |
| `SET_CLIENT_ID` | NetGet | nothing (as gearmand) |
| worker packets: `CAN_DO`, `CANT_DO`, `RESET_ABILITIES`, `PRE_SLEEP`, `GRAB_JOB*`, `WORK_*` from a client … | NetGet | `ERROR not_supported`, then close |
| `SUBMIT_JOB_SCHED`/`_EPOCH`, reduce jobs, `GET_STATUS_UNIQUE`, unknown types, a `\0RES` packet | NetGet | `ERROR not_supported` |
| wrong argument count, empty or >512-byte function, >64-byte unique id | NetGet | `ERROR invalid_arguments` |
| admin `status` | NetGet | `FUNCTION\tTOTAL\tRUNNING\tAVAILABLE_WORKERS` per function with jobs in flight, then `.` |
| admin `workers` | NetGet | `.` — no worker connections exist; the model is not one |
| admin `version` | NetGet | `OK netget-<version>` |
| admin `maxqueue`, `shutdown` | NetGet | `ERR NOT_SUPPORTED …` — they change server state |
| any other admin line | NetGet | `ERR UNKNOWN_COMMAND Unknown+server+command` |

**Worker connections are refused on purpose.** The model is the worker; a real worker that
registered here would sleep forever waiting for a job NetGet never queues for it. The `gearman
-w` CLI reports `GEARMAN_ERROR` and exits.

**What NetGet keeps**: the jobs in flight (handle, function, last progress) for `GET_STATUS`
and admin `status`, and a per-server handle counter (`H:netget:<n>`). A job leaves the table
when its answer is written. Nothing is queued and nothing is stored.

## What the model sees and controls

| Action | Renders |
|---|---|
| `complete_gearman_job {result}` | `WORK_COMPLETE handle result` — the `gearman` CLI prints the result |
| `fail_gearman_job` | `WORK_FAIL handle` — the CLI prints `Job failed` and exits 1 |
| `send_gearman_status {numerator, denominator}` | `WORK_STATUS` (numerator ≤ denominator) |
| `send_gearman_data {data}` | `WORK_DATA` — printed ahead of the result |
| `send_gearman_exception {text}` | `WORK_EXCEPTION`, or `WORK_FAIL` if the client did not enable exceptions (gearmand's rule) |
| `send_gearman_error {code, text}` | `ERROR code text` — code `[A-Za-z0-9_]{1,64}`, text without NUL |
| `close_connection` | close after the answer |

Every job action takes an optional `job_handle`. Answering the event, it may be omitted: the
executor returns the answer structured (`ActionResult::Custom "gearman_work"`) and the loop
renders it with the job's handle. Given, the executor renders the whole packet — which is what a
`[ message ]` injected from the dashboard needs — and the loop checks the handle is the job's.

### The loop enforces one outcome per foreground job

* Packets are written in the model's order until the first outcome (`WORK_COMPLETE`, `WORK_FAIL`,
  `WORK_EXCEPTION`, `ERROR`); anything after it is dropped and logged.
* An answer naming another handle, or a packet that is not a job answer →
  `WORK_FAIL`, `decision=fail_closed_mismatched_reply`.
* Progress without an outcome → the progress, then `WORK_FAIL`,
  `decision=fail_closed_unfinished` — the client would otherwise wait forever.
* Nothing at all → `WORK_FAIL`, `decision=model_silent`.

## Failure behaviour

`FailureMode::Answers`. A backend failure on a foreground job answers `WORK_FAIL` (the CLI exits
1), or `WORK_EXCEPTION` with the fixed text `job server backend unavailable` / `… at capacity` for
a client that enabled exceptions; `decision=fail_closed_llm_error category=…`. `ERROR` is **not**
used for failures: the `gearman` CLI exits **0** on an `ERROR` packet (measured), so it would read
as success. A model `WORK_COMPLETE` is `decision=model_answer`; a model fail/exception/error is
`decision=model_reject`. Background jobs write nothing after `JOB_CREATED` whatever happens; the
decision is logged with `background=true`. No error text reaches the peer.

## Bounds

| Bound | Value | Override | Why |
|---|---|---|---|
| `MAX_PACKET_BYTES` (= `max_inbound_bytes`) | 1 MiB | — | gearmand has no small limit because it queues workloads for workers; here the workload is a model prompt. Judged from the header's declared size before allocation; over it: `ERROR too_large`, close, `decision=fail_closed_too_large`. |
| argument count | per packet type | — | `split_args` splits on the first `n − 1` NULs only; the last argument keeps its own, so a body of 65,536 NULs is three arguments, not 65,537. |
| function / unique | 512 / 64 bytes | — | libgearman's own `GEARMAN_FUNCTION_MAX_SIZE` and `GEARMAN_MAX_UNIQUE_SIZE`. |
| `MAX_ADMIN_LINE` | 1024 incl. LF | — | Over it, or 1024 bytes with no newline: `ERR LINE_TOO_LONG`, close. |
| `FIRST_BYTE_TIMEOUT` | 300 s | `first_byte_timeout_secs` | The CLI writes at once; 300 s is the `manual` window for a NetGet TCP client parked on its operator. |
| `IDLE_TIMEOUT` | 300 s | `idle_timeout_secs` | Between messages, and between reads of a message that has started. A client waiting for its job's outcome is not idle — the deadline wraps reads, not the model. |
| `MAX_CONNECTIONS` | 256 (house default) | — | The peer past the cap is closed with no bytes (a packet it did not ask for would be misread). |

A binary message whose magic is not `\0REQ`/`\0RES` is closed unanswered
(`decision=fail_closed_bad_magic`). **Every close lingers** (2 s / 64 KiB), so an `ERROR` written
just before closing over unread input is not destroyed by an RST.

## Peer handle

Registered at connect: a job parked for a human can be answered from the dashboard with an action
that names its `job_handle`, or the connection closed.

## Wireshark

`gearman` is Wireshark's own dissector (`tshark -G protocols` lists it; decode-as
`tcp.port==N,gearman`). `real_client_test.rs` runs the pcap oracle over a real `gearman`
exchange recorded through a relay, and it is clean.

## Maturity

Beta. Evidence: `tests/server/gearman/real_client_test.rs` drives the gearmand project's own
`gearman` and `gearadmin` (libgearman, C++; not linked; the server uses no Gearman library) and
asserts on what they printed and how they exited — a job's data, result and progress, the
priority each flag chose, exit 1 on failure, a background job, `--ping`, the admin `status`,
`workers` and `version` with a job in flight, a refused worker, and a result written by a mocked
model; Wireshark's own `gearman` dissector reads a recorded exchange clean. It is not
`#[ignore]`d and fails, never skips, without the binaries; CI's `registry-audit` installs
Ubuntu's `gearman-tools` and runs it. The `gearman_packet` fuzz target has run clean. Promoted
after the whole suite (28 tests) passed three consecutive runs at `--test-threads=100` and
`scripts/beta_evidence_table.py --check` stayed green with `gearman` and `gearadmin` as the
peers.

What Beta does **not** cover, and what Stable would need: `gearman` and `gearadmin` are one
implementation (libgearman) — a second independent client, such as the Python `gearman` package
or the Go `mikespook/gearman-go`, is condition 1; workers are refused rather than served.
