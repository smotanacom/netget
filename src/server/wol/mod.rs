//! Wake-on-LAN magic packet listener.
//!
//! # Wake-on-LAN has no response, and that shapes everything here
//!
//! A magic packet is one-way. A real target NIC that recognises its own MAC in the payload
//! pulls the machine's power up and says nothing at all — there is no acknowledgement frame,
//! no status code, no transaction id, nothing the sender waits for. AMD's original
//! "Magic Packet Technology" white paper defines a payload and a NIC behaviour; it defines no
//! protocol exchange.
//!
//! So a Wake-on-LAN *server* is a **listener**, and the model has no reply to author. What it
//! genuinely decides is: whether this packet is interesting (which MACs this host pretends to
//! know about), and what is recorded about it. Those are the two actions
//! (`record_wake_request`, `ignore_magic_packet`). A third, `announce_host_awake`, is
//! explicitly **not part of Wake-on-LAN** and is off unless the operator turns it on — see
//! `CLAUDE.md`.
//!
//! Because there is no reply, an LLM failure is naturally silent, and that silence is
//! protocol-correct rather than a defect. It must still be distinguishable after the fact from
//! a deliberate drop, so every datagram produces exactly one `decision=` line — see
//! [`WolServer::decision_tag`].
//!
//! # The one decoding subtlety
//!
//! The magic packet is 6 bytes of `0xFF` followed by the 6-byte target MAC repeated exactly 16
//! times (102 bytes), optionally followed by a 4- or 6-byte SecureON password. It may sit
//! **anywhere inside the datagram** — senders wrap it, pad it, or encapsulate a whole Ethernet
//! frame — so [`decode_magic_packet`] scans for the sync stream rather than assuming offset 0.
