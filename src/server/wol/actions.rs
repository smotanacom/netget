//! Wake-on-LAN protocol actions.
//!
//! # The action set is small on purpose
//!
//! Wake-on-LAN defines no response (see `mod.rs`), so there is no reply for the model to
//! author and no wire verb to offer it. Padding the list with invented verbs would hand the
//! model a vocabulary that does not correspond to anything on the network.
//!
//! What is left is real, though, and it is what the event actually needs answering with:
//!
//! * `record_wake_request` — this packet is for a host I know about; keep it, with a label.
//! * `ignore_magic_packet` — it is not; drop it, and say why.
//! * `announce_host_awake` — **not part of Wake-on-LAN**, off unless the operator turns it on.
//!
//! Every one of them is attached to `wol_magic_packet_received` with `.with_actions(...)`, so
//! the model is never asked a question it has no vocabulary to answer.
//!
//! There are **no async actions**. An async action is a user-triggered verb that needs no
//! network context, and a listener that never transmits has none: `announce_host_awake` needs
//! both the per-server gate and the magic packet's source address, neither of which exists
//! outside the receive loop.
