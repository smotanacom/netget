//! HSRP (Hot Standby Router Protocol) actions, events and metadata.
//!
//! Everything the model sees is structured and named: states are words, not the numbers that
//! differ between the two versions; addresses are dotted quads; the authentication field is a
//! string. Nothing here accepts or emits raw bytes or base64 — see the action-design rules in
//! the root `CLAUDE.md`, and `codec.rs` for why the state numbering in particular must never
//! cross the boundary as an integer.
//!
//! **Read `src/server/hsrp/CLAUDE.md` before changing any of this.** The model picks the
//! priority and may send a Coup; winning makes NetGet the segment's default gateway.
