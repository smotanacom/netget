//! Actions, events and metadata for the generic raw IP protocol-N server.
//!
//! Nothing here is keyed on the operator's protocol number. There is one event and two
//! actions, and they read the same whether the socket is bound to GRE, ESP, SCTP or a number
//! IANA has never assigned — which is the point: this protocol is the generic home for IP
