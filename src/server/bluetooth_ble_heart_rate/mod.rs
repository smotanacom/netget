/// type** — 0 means a `uint8` in one octet, 1 means a `uint16` in two, little-endian. The other
/// flag bits describe optional fields (sensor contact, energy expended, RR-interval) that this
/// encoder does not emit, so they stay clear.
///
/// The format bit and the field width are chosen together here rather than left to the caller,
/// because disagreeing about them is the invisible failure this function exists to prevent: a
/// central handed `00 48 00` reads 72 BPM and then a stray octet it cannot account for, while
/// `01 48` is one octet short of the uint16 the flags promised.
///
/// **There is deliberately no clamp.** This used to be `[0x00, bpm.clamp(30, 220)]`, so a
/// caller asking for 25 got a confident 30 and one asking for 250 got 220 — an obvious error
/// silently rewritten into a believable claim about a human heart. The spec constrains the
/// field width and nothing else, so the width is all this enforces; whether a number is a
/// *plausible* heart rate is a judgement the wire format does not make and neither does this.
