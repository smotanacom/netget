//! Reverse-shell listener server.
//!
//! A raw-TCP listener that **emulates** the operator side of a reverse shell for authorized
//! security testing, CTF and lab use. An operator connects back to this listener with a plain
//! TCP client (`nc`, `socat`, `ncat`), and the LLM role-plays the shell on the far end: it
//! decides the banner, each command's output and the prompt.
//!
//! Safety: NetGet does **not** execute the operator's commands on this host. Every byte the
//! operator sees is fictional output supplied by the model — the same premise as every other
//! NetGet protocol (impersonating a service without being one). Real command execution is only
//! reachable through the separate, opt-in, unsandboxed scripting layer documented in the
//! top-level `CLAUDE.md`; this protocol never touches it. See `src/server/reverse_shell/CLAUDE.md`.
//!
//! Wire model: there is no framing. The listener reads raw bytes, buffers them into
//! newline-terminated lines, and raises one `reverse_shell_command` event per line. One
//! connection is handled strictly sequentially — the model call for one line finishes before the
//! next line is read — so there is never a concurrent LLM call on a single connection, and input
//! that arrives mid-call sits in the socket buffer until the call returns.
