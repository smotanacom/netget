//! IPv6 Neighbour Discovery (RFC 4861) server — NetGet as a router, or as a neighbour, on
//! somebody else's link.
//!
//! NDP is what IPv6 replaced ARP, ICMP Router Discovery and ICMP Redirect with. Five ICMPv6
//! messages carry the whole thing: hosts ask for routers (133) and routers answer (134), nodes
//! ask where an address lives (135) and answer (136), and a router can move a destination to a
//! different first hop (137).
//!
//! **The Router Advertisement is the reason this protocol is here.** One of them hands a link its
//! prefix, its default route and — through RDNSS (RFC 8106) — its DNS resolvers, and every host
//! on the segment accepts it from anybody, unauthenticated. That is what `mitm6` exploits, and
//! having a model author one is the point of the protocol.
//!
//! # Two transports, one codec
//!
//! The packet format lives in [`codec`] and is a pure function over plain values. This module is
//! the thin layer that moves those bytes:
//!
//! * **`transport: "raw"`** (the default) — a raw ICMPv6 socket. Needs root or `CAP_NET_RAW`.
//!   **This code has never been executed**; see `CLAUDE.md`.
//! * **`transport: "udp"`** — a testing transport whose datagrams carry
//!   `source(16) || destination(16) || ICMPv6 message`, so the whole event → handler/LLM →
//!   message path runs unprivileged *including the pseudo-header checksum*, which needs both
//!   addresses and is therefore the one part a naive test transport would quietly skip. No real
//!   IPv6 stack speaks it. This is the same accommodation `ospf` makes for its raw socket, made
//!   explicit as a declared parameter rather than left to the test file.
//!
//! # No timer, deliberately
//!
//! A real router advertises unprompted every few minutes. This server does not, and will not: an
//! unsolicited Router Advertisement reconfigures every host that hears it, and a NetGet instance
//! left running would keep doing so. Every advertisement here comes from an explicit model
//! action in response to something received.
//!
//! # Failure is silence, and the log is where the difference lives
//!
//! NDP is in the deliberately-silent class the root `CLAUDE.md` describes, and its case is among
//! the strongest in the repository. Every message the protocol defines is a *positive assertion*
//! about addressing on this link: an answer writes a binding into the peer's neighbour cache, and
//! a Router Advertisement rewrites its entire routing and DNS configuration. There is no error
//! message to send. Fabricating one on an LLM failure is cache poisoning at best and a full
//! traffic redirect at worst, so this server emits **nothing**, and no `WireFailure` text ever
//! reaches the wire.
//!
//! On the wire all the outcomes are identical, so they are separated in the log by a `decision=`
//! tag, the way `src/server/radius/` separates its cases:
//!
//! | Tag | Meaning |
//! |---|---|
//! | `decision=no_policy` | No instruction and no handler — nothing sent and no LLM call is made |
//! | `decision=model_reject` | The model answered `no_response` — a real decision |
//! | `decision=model_silent` | The model returned nothing usable |
//! | `decision=fail_closed_overloaded` | The call failed and the backend is saturated (retryable) |
//! | `decision=fail_closed_llm_error` | The call failed otherwise |
