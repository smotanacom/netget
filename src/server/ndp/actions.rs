//! NDP protocol actions, events and metadata.
//!
//! What the model decides here is **what a peer's IPv6 stack will believe**. A Neighbour
//! Advertisement writes an entry into its neighbour cache; a Router Advertisement writes its
//! prefix, its default route and — through RDNSS — its DNS resolvers. Both are accepted from
//! anybody on the link, unauthenticated. That is the protocol, not a defect in this
//! implementation, and it is the reason `mitm6` works.
//!
//! Two rules shape everything below:
//!
//! 1. **Every field is structured.** Addresses are IPv6 strings, link-layer addresses are
//!    `"00:11:22:33:44:55"`, flags are booleans, lifetimes are seconds. There is no parameter
//!    that accepts octets and there never should be.
//! 2. **Every message is a positive assertion, so there is no error message to send.** When
//!    there is nothing to say, NDP says nothing — see `no_response`, and the failure handling in
//!    `mod.rs`.
