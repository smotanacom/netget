            //
            // The demotion that preceded this was right about russh and wrong about the
            // tests. russh IS the library this server is built on, so driving the server
            // with russh would be the circular case — that part stands. But the tests do
            // not use russh: they use `ssh2`, which is a binding to the C libssh2 and
            // shares no line of code with russh. The claim that libssh2 "does not complete
            // a session" came from a stale comment in `tests/server/ssh/test.rs`,
            // describing a runtime-blocking bug that was fixed by moving libssh2 onto

            // Check what the test drives, not what the server links.

            // Since September 2026 the rating rests on TWO independent clients rather than
            // one: libssh2 as above, and the real OpenSSH `ssh` binary in
            // tests/server/ssh/real_client_test.rs. One client can agree with one bug, and

                 with the russh this server is built on) completes real sessions, in tests \
                 that are neither #[ignore]d nor skip-gated. \
                 test_sftp_basic_operations is the evidence: transport handshake, password \
                 auth, the SFTP subsystem, opendir/readdir, open+read and lstat, with the \
                 file's bytes and the declared size asserted exactly. \
                 test_ssh_python_auth_script and test_ssh_script_fallback_to_llm drive \
                 libssh2 password auth through a script handler and through the model, and \
                 llm_failure_test asserts libssh2 sees a refusal on all three fail-closed \
                 paths. test_ssh_connection_attempt asserts libssh2 completes the handshake \
                 and is then refused a login no handler granted. Alongside these, bare \
                 TcpStream tests cover the banner, version exchange and concurrent connects. \
                 SECOND CLIENT: the real OpenSSH `ssh` binary, in \
                 tests/server/ssh/real_client_test.rs. A third implementation again - neither \
                 russh nor libssh2 - and the one an operator actually types. It authenticates \
                 with a generated ed25519 key (BatchMode, so nothing can prompt), runs a \
                 one-shot `ssh host <command>` over an exec channel, and the test asserts the \
                 exact bytes on stdout AND the exit status OpenSSH reports from the SSH \
                 exit-status request; a second session with a username the model refuses is \
                 asserted to come back as OpenSSH's own `Permission denied` and exit 255. It \
                 FAILS rather than skips when ssh/ssh-keygen are absent, and is not #[ignore]d. \
                 Verified non-vacuous by inverting llm_auth_decision's accepted branch (the \
                 admitted session became `Permission denied` and exit 255) and by forcing \
                 exec_request's success exit status to 69 (stdout was still byte-for-byte \
                 correct and ONLY the exit code moved, so a test reading stdout alone would \
                 have passed). \
                 WHAT THE SECOND CLIENT FOUND (1), now FIXED: NetGet sent \
                 SSH_MSG_CHANNEL_CLOSE twice on an exec channel - once from exec_request with \
                 the exit status, once from channel_eof when the client's own EOF arrived. \
                 RFC 4254 section 5.3 allows one per party. OpenSSH disconnected with `oclose \
                 packet referred to nonexistent channel 0` and exit 255 whenever it had \
                 already freed the channel, so `ssh host cmd` failed about one run in five \
                 AFTER the output and exit-status 0 had arrived intact. libssh2 ignores the \
                 second CLOSE, so nothing else here could see it. SshHandler::close_channel_once \
                 is the fix; measured 4 failures in 20 runs before, 0 in 25 after. \
                 WHAT THE SECOND CLIENT FOUND (2), NOT fixed: NetGet applies \
                 normalize_line_endings on the \
                 EXEC path, where no PTY exists, so `ssh host cmd` returns CRLF where a real \
                 sshd returns LF - the CRLF an interactive session shows comes from the pty's \
                 ONLCR, not from the server. `OUT=$(ssh host cmd)` therefore leaves a stray \
                 CR. Not fixed here (mod.rs handles no pty_request at all, so the honest fix \
                 is channel bookkeeping); the test asserts and names the current behaviour. \
                 STILL UNPROVEN: openssh's `sftp` binary, and an interactive shell through any \
                 third-party client - only exec and SFTP are covered.",

            .notes(
                "FAILS CLOSED: an LLM error, a handler that returns no ssh_auth_decision, and \
                 a malformed decision all deny, logged as decision=fail_closed_* and never as \
                 decision=model_reject. Shell and SFTP only: no port forwarding, no X11, no \
                 keyboard-interactive. SFTP is read-only (write/remove/mkdir/rmdir/rename are \
                 not implemented) and serves no real filesystem — every listing, stat and byte \
                 comes from the model. Host key is regenerated on every start, so clients warn \
                 about a changed key. Shell output has \\n rewritten to \\r\\n on EVERY path, \
                 including the one-shot exec channel where no PTY exists and a real sshd would \
                 not translate - so `ssh host cmd` returns CRLF and `$(ssh host cmd)` keeps a \
                 trailing CR.",
