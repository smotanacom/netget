//! Sector storage behind the virtual USB mass storage device.
//!
//! Two backings, and which one is the **default** is the whole point:
//!
//! * [`Backing::Memory`] — a `Vec<u8>` that never touches the filesystem. This is the default,
//!   and it is what an LLM-supplied file map is laid out into
//!   (`super::fat16::build_volume`). Nothing persists, nothing is created in the working
//!   directory, and the only data on the wire is data the model supplied.
//! * [`Backing::Mapped`] — a memory-mapped file, reached only when the caller **names a path**
//!   in `startup_params.disk_image` or in a `mount_disk` action.
//!
//! It used to be file-only, and the default path was `./tmp/netget_msc_disk.img` relative to
//! the process's working directory. That made the protocol *implement storage*, which the
//! project rule forbids: the sectors a host read came from a file on disk, not from the model,
//! and the read/write events were decorative notifications about data nobody had been asked
//! for. A path the caller names is host state the model refers to — the same shape as `proxy`'s
//! `ca_export_path` — and it is opt-in now rather than the default.
