//! USB HID Mouse server implementation
//!
//! This module implements a virtual USB HID mouse using the USB/IP protocol.
//! The mouse can be controlled by the LLM to move the cursor, click buttons,
//! and scroll the wheel.
//!
//! ## What was wrong here
//!
//! `handle_connection` took the accepted socket as `_stream` and **dropped it**. It never ran
//! a USB/IP session at all: it logged "NOT YET FUNCTIONAL - waiting for usbip crate mouse
//! support", called the LLM once for `usb_mouse_attached`, and then parked on
//! `sleep(Duration::from_secs(u64::MAX))` forever. So the device could not be enumerated, let
//! alone imported; `usb_mouse_detached` had no emit site and could never fire; and the
//! connection task leaked for the lifetime of the process.
//!
//! The premise was also stale. `usbip` 0.9 still has no mouse handler, but netget has had its
//! own complete one in `handler.rs` — report descriptor, 4-byte reports, automatic release —
//! for some time. Nothing was wired to it.
//!
//! ## When the LLM call fails, the mouse stays still — deliberately
//!
//! A HID mouse owes the host no reply. The host polls the interrupt IN endpoint and is NAKed
//! whenever the pointer is not moving, which is what every mouse does most of the time; there is
//! no HID vocabulary for "the device's brain is unreachable", and STALLing the endpoint is a
//! fault that makes a host reset or unbind the device rather than a refusal it can act on.
//! (`usbip` cannot express it either — returning `Err` from `handle_urb` aborts the session for
//! the whole device.)
//!
//! What matters is the other direction, and it comes for free: a failed LLM call must never move
//! the pointer or press a button. Reports exist only where an action produced them.
//!
//! So the failure is dual-logged at ERROR and nothing is sent.
//! `tests/server/usb_mouse/llm_failure_test.rs` pins both halves.
//!
//! Because the wire looks identical in every failure mode, the log is the only place the cases
//! are distinguishable, and each carries a `decision=` tag: `decision=fail_closed_llm_error`
//! when the backend erred, `decision=no_action` when the model answered with nothing, and
//! `decision=model_action` when it queued reports. There is no `decision=model_reject`: this
//! protocol advertises no verb with which a model can refuse (`wait_for_more` is holding still,
//! which is an action).
