//! USB CDC ACM interface handler.
//!
//! `usbip` 0.9 ships `cdc::UsbCdcAcmHandler`, but it is a demo: a host write on the bulk OUT
//! endpoint is logged and thrown away, and the class-specific control requests that make a
//! serial port a serial port (`SET_LINE_CODING`, `GET_LINE_CODING`,
//! `SET_CONTROL_LINE_STATE`) are not handled at all. Both matter here — without the first,
//! `usb_serial_data_received` can never fire; without the second, a host that opens the port
//! and configures it gets no answer.
//!
//! So the CDC *descriptors* and the endpoint layout are taken from the crate (it is the
//! authority on what a CDC ACM interface looks like on the wire) while the URB handling is
//! implemented here.
