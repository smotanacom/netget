# Spark — Apache Spark monitoring REST / history API server

The LLM roleplays a Spark application's control plane and invents the applications, jobs, stages
and executors it reports (the Kubernetes/OCI "model is the control plane" pattern). NetGet owns the
HTTP stack (hyper v1, `http1::serve_connection`); the model only decides state.

**Port**: 4040 (live driver UI/REST) or 18080 (History Server). **Privilege**: `None` (both ports
unprivileged — do NOT declare `PrivilegedPort`). **Stack**: `ETH>IP>TCP>HTTP>SPARK`.
**State**: Experimental. No storage.

## Endpoints

| Method + path | Operation | Handled by |
|---|---|---|
| `GET /api/v1/version` | version | **static** (banner, no LLM) |
| `GET /api/v1/applications` | applications | LLM → `send_spark_applications` |
| `GET /api/v1/applications/{id}` | application | LLM → `send_spark_applications` (one element) |
| `GET /api/v1/applications/{id}/jobs` | jobs | LLM → `send_spark_jobs` |
| `GET /api/v1/applications/{id}/stages` | stages | LLM → `send_spark_stages` |
| `GET /api/v1/applications/{id}/executors` | executors | LLM → `send_spark_executors` |
| other `/api/v1/applications/{id}/...` | application | LLM (answer or 404 via `send_spark_error`) |
| anything else | unknown | **static** 404 plain text (no LLM) |

**Static vs LLM split**: `/api/v1/version` is a mechanical version string, answered directly in
`mod.rs` from the `spark_version` startup param — no model round-trip. Unrecognised paths get a
static plain-text 404. Everything describing (invented) application state is LLM-driven.

## Response shapes

Spark's monitoring API returns **top-level JSON arrays**, not objects. `execute_action` emits the
array supplied by the model directly as the body (`Content-Type: application/json`):
`[{application}]`, `[{job}]`, `[{stage}]`, `[{executor}]`. `/api/v1/version` is the one object,
`{"spark":"<version>"}`. Errors are plain text (`Content-Type: text/plain`), matching Spark
(e.g. `unknown app: app-1`) — except the fail-closed path, see below.

## Events / actions

One event type, `spark_request`, emitted for every LLM-handled request (version/unknown
short-circuit before it). It declares the full action set via `.with_actions(...)`, and every
action is reachable, so nothing is declared-but-unemitted.

Actions: `send_spark_applications`, `send_spark_jobs`, `send_spark_stages`,
`send_spark_executors`, `send_spark_error`. All parameters are structured JSON arrays — never raw
bytes or base64. `spark_response` is the internal `ActionResult::Custom` name, not an emittable
action.

## Fail-closed

On an LLM error the server answers **503** (overload/retryable) or **500** with a JSON error object
`{"error": "...", "status": ...}`. When the model succeeds but emits no `spark_response`, the
server answers **500** rather than a bare `[]` with 200 — an empty array is a valid "no
applications/jobs" result and a client cannot tell it from a backend that never ran. The failure
path (a JSON *object* with an `error` field) is structurally distinct from any success array.

## Failure behaviour

**Every terminal outcome is decided inside `src/server/spark/mod.rs`.** This server does *not*
delegate to `src/server/http_common/handler.rs` — it owns its own `service_fn`, its own
`build_spark_response`/`build_spark_error`, and its own LLM call site — so the whole decision
table below lives in one file and there is no shared handler to consult.

The wire cannot carry the distinction on its own: `send_spark_error` lets the model choose a
status, so a model-chosen 500 and a fail-closed 500 are the same three digits. The `decision=`
token is where they separate.

| Outcome | On the wire | Log |
|---|---|---|
| Model returned `spark_response` with a status < 400 | that status + the model's body | INFO `decision=model_answer` |
| Model returned `spark_response` with a status ≥ 400 | that status + the model's body | INFO `decision=model_reject` |
| Model answered with no `spark_response` action | `500` + `{"error": …, "status": 500}` | WARN `decision=model_silent` |
| `call_llm` failed (unavailable) | `500` + JSON error object, `WireFailure` category text only | ERROR `decision=fail_closed_llm_error` |
| `call_llm` failed (overloaded) | `503` + JSON error object | ERROR `decision=fail_closed_llm_overloaded` |
| `GET /api/v1/version` | `200` + `{"spark": …}` | DEBUG `decision=static_answer` |
| Unrecognised path | `404` plain text | DEBUG `decision=unknown_endpoint` |

`decision=static_answer` and `decision=unknown_endpoint` are invented tokens for the two paths
the model never sees: calling either `model_answer` would credit a decision nobody made. Both
are DEBUG, so they stay in `netget.log` and off the status stream — the two LLM-failure tokens
and `model_silent` are what an operator greps.

**A narrowing cast that used to live here is fixed.** `handle_spark_request_inner` narrowed the
model's `status` with `.unwrap_or(200) as u16`, and `65736 as u16` is `200` — so a nonsense
status became the one code a client reads as success. It now goes through a local `status_or`,
the same shape `oauth2` uses: `u16::try_from` plus a 100–599 range filter, falling back to the
declared default and logging the value it refused. The payoff here was a bogus monitoring
answer rather than a credential, but a monitoring API fabricating a `200` is precisely what a
monitoring API must not do.

## Startup parameters

`spark_version` (optional, default `3.5.1`) — the version in the static `/api/v1/version` banner,
actually read in `spawn()`. `send_first` is not declared.

## Limitations

Monitoring API only (the tractable, testable core). No standalone-master submission endpoint
(`POST /v1/submissions/create`), no SQL/streaming/environment/storage sub-resources, no
event-log download. HTTP/1.1 only. State is virtual and lives only in the model's context.

**No authentication of any kind**, and nothing about the requester reaches the model: the
`spark_request` event carries `method`, `path`, `operation` and `app_id` and nothing else, so
there is no header, credential or peer address for it to decide on. Every request is answered
unconditionally. (The event's log template used to interpolate `{client_ip}` and
`{client_port}`, which the event has never carried — a missing field renders as the empty
string, so every INFO line read `Spark  GET /api/v1/applications`.)

**Request bodies are capped** at `MAX_REQUEST_BYTES` (64 KiB) through
`http_body_util::Limited`. The monitoring API is read-only and the body is used for nothing but
a `trace!` line, but it was read with an unbounded `collect()`, which made an unauthenticated
POST of any size a way to grow the process. An over-cap body is dropped, not refused — nothing
downstream reads it and every endpoint here is a GET.

**Maturity stays `Experimental`, deliberately.** The tests drive `reqwest`, a generic HTTP
client: it proves the server answers HTTP and that the bodies are the JSON arrays Spark's API
documents, not that a real Spark client or History Server UI accepts them. That is the
generic-HTTP-client exclusion the root `CLAUDE.md` lists, and it is the whole distance between
this rating and Beta.

## Connection bounds

Before September 2026 this server accepted without limit and bounded no read in time, so a peer
that connected and said nothing held a socket, a connection task and an `AppState` entry forever,
pre-authentication, on a server that would happily accept a hundred more. It now declares both
halves; the constants and the reasoning live beside them in `src/server/spark/mod.rs`.

| Bound | Value | Why this number |
|---|---|---|
| `FIRST_BYTE_READ_TIMEOUT` | 30s | HTTP is client-speaks-first, so a peer that has connected and sent no byte has begun no request. 30s sits between nginx's `client_header_timeout` default of 60s and Apache's `RequestReadTimeout header=20`. Enforced with `TcpStream::peek` before the socket reaches hyper, so the request line is still there for hyper afterwards. |
| `IDLE_BETWEEN_REQUESTS_TIMEOUT` | 180s | The monitoring API is read-only and polled on a seconds-to-minutes cycle, so the silence measured is a poller that has stopped. Above any scrape interval anyone configures and more than twice nginx's `keepalive_timeout` default of 75s. |
| `MAX_CONNECTIONS` | 256 | Each admitted connection may hold one whole in-memory response body (a JSON response), so the cap turns that per-connection bound into a total one. Refusal: **HTTP/1.1 `503 Service Unavailable` with `Retry-After: 5`** — a 503 is what a monitoring client and a dashboard both already understand. Nothing of netget's reaches the wire; the reason is logged under `decision=fail_closed_connection_cap`. |

**The idle bound is a watchdog, not a read deadline, and that is not a stylistic choice.** hyper
owns every read once `serve_connection` starts and keeps polling the connection for new frames
*while a request is being answered*, so a deadline on those reads would fire in the middle of an
LLM round-trip. It watches `ConnectionActivity` instead, which reports a connection with work in
flight as not idle at all — so the model round-trip, and a `manual` rule parking an event for a
human (`src/state/intercepts.rs`, 300s by default), sit outside every deadline by construction.
That is the `.connectionless()` lesson in the project `CLAUDE.md` read in reverse: TFTP evicted
live transfers because "idle" was measured wrongly.

**One residual, stated rather than hidden.** The first-byte bound is discharged the moment any
byte arrives, so a peer that sends one byte of a request line and then stops is bounded by the
*idle* deadline (180s) rather than by the 30s one. hyper's own `header_read_timeout` cannot
express the pair: it re-arms whenever hyper starts reading a head, an idle keep-alive connection
included, so setting it to 30s would close every pooled client between requests — collapsing the
two bounds onto one number, which is exactly what the pair exists to avoid.

`tests/server/spark/connection_bounds_test.rs` drives all three from the wire, over
`tests/helpers/http_bounds.rs`. Each was verified by **removing** the bound and watching the test
fail: with the `peek` deadline gone the silent peer still held the socket at 60s; with the idle
bound collapsed to 30s an answered connection was closed after 38s of silence; with the permit
released early the connection past the cap was served instead of refused.
