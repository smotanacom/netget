//! Apache Spark monitoring REST API server.
//!
//! Serves the Spark monitoring endpoints a client / the History Server UI hits
//! (`/api/v1/applications`, `.../{id}/jobs`, `/stages`, `/executors`). The LLM roleplays the
//! application's control plane, inventing applications/jobs/stages/executors per request.
//!
//! Static vs LLM-driven:
//! - `GET /api/v1/version` — mechanical version banner, answered **statically** (no LLM).
//! - Unrecognised paths get a static 404 (plain text), no LLM call.
//! - `applications`, `jobs`, `stages`, `executors` — **LLM-driven**.
//!
//! Fail-closed: on an LLM error, or when the model produces no `spark_response`, the server
//! answers 503/500 with a JSON error object — never a success-shaped empty array (which a client
//! cannot distinguish from a genuinely empty application list).
