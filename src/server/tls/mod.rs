/// How long a peer has to complete the TLS handshake.
///
/// **One constant used to govern this wait and the wait for the first application record**, on
/// the reasoning that from the peer's side they are one condition: it holds a socket and has
/// produced nothing usable. They are not one condition, because they face different peers.
/// This one faces a peer that has opened a TCP socket and not yet sent a ClientHello; the
/// other faces a peer that has *completed* a handshake. A single number cannot be right for
/// both, and the number that was right here was wrong there.
///
/// Nothing on this side of the split has changed. `acceptor.accept()` was once unbounded, so a
/// peer that connected and never sent a ClientHello held a task and a rustls state machine for
/// as long as it liked — cheaper for an attacker than a completed connection. Every real
/// client sends ClientHello immediately and finishes in one round-trip, and NetGet's own TLS
/// client is no exception: `src/client/tls/mod.rs` runs `TlsConnector::connect` inside its own
/// `connect()`, before any model turn or keystroke, so a minute is far beyond what any peer
/// worth waiting for needs, even on a bad link. Nothing in this phase involves the model, so
/// the deadline may cover the whole of it.
///

/// How long a handshaked peer has to send its first *application* record.
///
/// **This was [`HANDSHAKE_READ_TIMEOUT`]'s 60 seconds, and the peer it faces is a different
/// one.** The handshake is done here: the peer has proved it speaks TLS and has paid for a
/// rustls state machine of its own. What it has not done is say anything on top — and TLS is a
/// carrier, so whether it *should* have by now is a property of the application riding on it,
/// which this server does not know.
///
/// What it does know is who is usually there. `src/client/tls/mod.rs` completes the handshake
/// inside `connect()` and then writes **no application bytes at all** unprompted: every byte
/// comes from an action, and a client created from the dashboard's `[ + tls client ]` is
/// routed `tls_client_connected` → static-with-no-actions and then `*` → manual
/// (`src/tui/modal/form.rs`). So it connects, handshakes, is answered with nothing, and waits
/// for a person to type into `[ send message ]`. At 60 seconds this server hung up on the
/// operator's own client while they were still looking at it — and, unlike the handshake
/// phase, there was nothing the peer could have done about it.
///
/// 300 seconds is the window a `manual` rule gives a human to answer one event
/// (`src/state/intercepts.rs`), which is the number this product already uses for how long
/// someone might take, and it is also this server's own [`IDLE_AFTER_DATA_TIMEOUT`] — so a
/// hand-driven session is now bounded the same way before its first record as after it.
///
/// What it costs: a peer that completed a handshake and then said nothing holds a socket, a
/// task, an `AppState` row and one of [`MAX_CONNECTIONS`] slots for 300 seconds rather than
/// 60 — a fivefold rise in how long one such slot is held, not a removal of the bound, and a
/// peer over the cap is still answered [`CONNECTION_CAP_REFUSAL`]. Note that it is also
/// strictly more expensive for the attacker than the handshake phase, which is untouched: to
/// reach this bound at all it must complete a real TLS handshake. A listener exposed to
/// strangers should set `first_byte_timeout_secs` low; 60 is the old value and remains a sound
