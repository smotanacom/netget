# MCP Server Implementation (STDIO + HTTP)

## Overview

Runs NetGet as an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server, allowing MCP clients like
Claude Desktop and Claude Code to control protocol servers programmatically. Two
transports share the exact same tool implementation:

- **STDIO** (`--mcp`, feature `mcp-stdio`): one client over stdin/stdout. Used by
  Claude Desktop / Claude Code.
- **HTTP/SSE** (`--mcp-http PORT`, feature `mcp-http`): the MCP Streamable HTTP
  transport for remote/web clients. Multiple sessions share one `SharedState`
  (servers started in one session are visible to all). Bind address comes from
  `--listen-addr` (default `127.0.0.1`).

The two flags are mutually exclusive.

## Architecture

```
MCP Client (Claude Desktop/Code, or remote HTTP client)
  | stdin/stdout OR HTTP/SSE (JSON-RPC 2.0)
  v
rmcp STDIO transport  /  rmcp StreamableHttpService
  |
  v
NetGetMcpService (tools.rs)
  |--- MCP tools (list_protocols, start_server, get_next_llm_request, ...)
  |--- AppState (shared server/client state)
  v
Protocol Servers (tcp, http, dns, ...)
  |
  v
OllamaClient (3 backends)
  |--- Ollama /api/chat        (local)
  |--- OpenAI /v1/chat         (remote)
  |--- Agent queue (--llm-agent): the calling MCP agent answers
```

## Library

- **rmcp** v1.2 - Official Rust MCP SDK
- Base features (`mcp-stdio`): `server`, `transport-io`, `client`
  (the `client` feature is enabled so the in-process smoke tests can drive the server)
- Added by `mcp-http`: `transport-streamable-http-server` (+ `axum` for the router/listener)
- **schemars** v1.0 - JSON Schema generation for tool parameters

## Entry Points

`netget --mcp` (alias `--mcp-stdio`) triggers `mcp_stdio::run_mcp_stdio()`:
1. Creates `NetGetMcpService` with AppState and tool router
2. Serves via `rmcp::transport::stdio()` (stdin/stdout)
3. Waits until client disconnects (stdin EOF)

`netget --mcp-http PORT` triggers `mcp_stdio::run_mcp_http()`:
1. Builds `SharedState` once via `NetGetMcpService::create_shared_state()`
2. Wraps it in an rmcp `StreamableHttpService` (one `NetGetMcpService` per session,
   all sharing the same `SharedState`) mounted at `/mcp` on an axum router
3. Serves until the process is stopped

## Protocol documentation (`docs.rs`)

`get_protocol_docs` has its own renderer (`src/mcp_stdio/docs.rs`) rather than
reusing the TUI LLM's `read_documentation`. The internal renderer describes the
`open_server` / `open_client` **actions** and a `base_stack` parameter — an API
no MCP caller can invoke. `docs.rs` renders what an MCP caller actually has:

- the exact `start_server` / `start_client` arguments that apply to the protocol
  (interface-bound protocols get `interface`/`mac_address` instead of `port`/`host`);
- its event ids with field names and types, so `event_handlers` scripts can be
  written without guessing;
- its action names with parameter schemas and JSON examples — **async ones included**, since
  `send_to_client` and `send_to_peer` make them invocable from MCP;
- its `startup_params` schema — each parameter with `default: <v>` where the protocol declares
  the value it falls back to (`ParameterDefinition::default`) — privilege requirement and
  maturity;
- for a server, its `failure_mode` (what the peer gets when the model cannot answer) and
  whether it is `connectionless`.

`llm::actions::tools::execute_read_documentation` is untouched — the TUI's
`/docs` command and the internal LLM still use it.

## `start_server` without a `port`

An omitted `port` means the protocol's **well-known port** (`ProtocolMetadataV2::well_known_port`
— 6379 for redis, 53 for dns), resolved by `protocol::default_port` inside
`start_server_from_action`, so `open_server`, `--server` and the dashboard get the same answer:

- 1024 or above: taken as is.
- below 1024: taken when `SystemCapabilities::can_bind_privileged_ports`, otherwise an
  OS-assigned port;
- already held on the bind address (probed with the port's own transport): an OS-assigned port.

Every fallback puts one line in the tool result saying which and why ("well-known port 53 needs
root; starting on an OS-assigned port"). A protocol with no well-known port (tcp, udp, the
HTTP-carried mocks, anything interface- or path-bound — the list and the reasons are in
`tests/well_known_port_declaration_test.rs`) starts on an OS-assigned port.

**An explicit `port`, `0` included, is never replaced**, and a taken explicit port is an error.
Every MCP test passes `"port": 0`, so none of them depends on the default. Before this, an omitted
port was an error ("requires 'port' parameter") for every protocol without a `default_binding()`
— most of them — while `get_protocol_docs` said `0` was the default; the docs now render the
resolved default for this process, and the `start_server` schema says the same.

## Client control surface

`start_client` / `list_clients` / `client_status` / `stop_client` mirror the
server tools and route through `cli::client_startup::start_client_from_action`,
exactly as `start_server` routes through `start_server_from_action`. They take
the same `instruction` / `event_handlers` / `startup_params` /
`initial_memory` / `feedback_instructions` / `scheduled_tasks` arguments plus a
`remote_addr`.

**`stop_client` really stops a client.** `AppState::register_client_task()`
stores every background task a client spawns in `ClientInstance.handles` (a `Vec`,
not a single slot — several protocols spawn more than one task), and
`remove_client()` aborts them all. Dropping a Tokio `JoinHandle` only detaches the
task, so the abort is what releases the socket and stops further LLM calls.

Client protocols register their tasks from `connect_with_llm_actions`. Four spawn
sites are still unregistered because they have no `app_state` / `client_id` in
scope: `amqp`, `oauth2`, and the non-async helper spawns in `maven` and
`bluetooth`. For those, `stop_client` still only drops the bookkeeping. Protocols
that spawn nothing at all (`arp`, `datalink`, `isis`, `mssql`, `nfc`, `sqs`,
`syslog`, …) have no task to abort and are unaffected.

Related: clients also carry a per-session LLM call budget
(`AppState::try_consume_client_llm_call`, default 100, override with
`NETGET_CLIENT_LLM_CALL_LIMIT`, `0` = unlimited) so a non-converging client cannot
loop forever.

## Driving by hand (`send_to_client`, `send_to_peer`, intercepts)

Six tools give an MCP caller what the dashboard's buttons give a human. Each wraps an
`AppState` method the dashboard already calls; what the tool adds is **validation before
anything reaches a running loop** (`src/mcp_stdio/control.rs`): an action whose `type` the
target cannot execute is refused with the list of names it can, instead of travelling into the
connection task and coming back as an executor error.

- **`send_to_client {client_id, action, timeout_secs?}`** — `action` is checked against
  `client_llm_action_set` (async ∪ sync, what the model is shown). A client with no command
  channel (not connected, or a protocol that never registered one) fails **at once**; it does
  not wait out the timeout. If the client's loop is parked on a manual question, the error
  says so and names the request — its loop drains no commands until that is answered.
- **`send_to_peer {server_id, connection_id, action, timeout_secs?}`** — checked against the
  server protocol's sync ∪ async actions; needs a peer handle (`server/peer_support.rs`),
  which `server_status` now reports per connection alongside the connection ids a caller
  needs. **`disconnect_peer`** sends the protocol's own `close_connection` through the same
  handle and refuses on a protocol that declares none.
- **`list_intercepts`** — every request parked by a `manual` handler: id, owner and
  connection, event type and data, the actions it may be answered with (`name(param*, …)`),
  and seconds until it fails closed (`PendingIntercept::timeout_secs`, recorded at park time).
- **`answer_intercept {intercept_id, actions}`** — checked against the firing event's own
  actions ∪ the protocol's sync actions (for a client, its whole set) plus the common actions
  — the catalog a static handler for that event is held to. A refused answer leaves the
  request waiting. **`[]` is a real answer**: nothing is written and the connection carries
  on, which is distinct from a timeout.
- **`fail_intercept {intercept_id}`** — refuses now; the dispatcher takes the fail-closed path
  (TCP half-closes, HTTP answers an error status). There is deliberately **no separate
  `dismiss_intercept` tool**: `AppState::dismiss_intercept` *is* the dashboard's `[ Fail
  closed ]` — dropping the reply sender is what wakes the dispatcher onto the fail-closed
  branch — so a second tool would be the same call under another name.

`tests/mcp_client_send_test.rs` and `tests/mcp_intercept_test.rs` assert each of these from the
peer's side of a real socket (bytes read, EOF observed), not from the tool's text.

## In-place update (`update_server` / `update_client`)

`update_server` / `update_client` amend a **running** server/client by id instead of starting a
second one, and route through `cli::management::update_server` / `update_client` (the same code
the TUI's management UI uses). Supply only the fields to change.

- **Hot-applied without dropping connections/reconnecting**: `instruction`, `event_handlers`,
  `initial_memory`, `feedback_instructions`, `scheduled_tasks`.
- **Requires a clean stop+start / reconnect** (connections dropped, the entity gets a **new id**):
  `port` / `host` for a server, `remote_addr` for a client, and `startup_params` for either.
- An unknown id and invalid `startup_params` **error cleanly and leave the running entity
  untouched** (validation happens before any restart). `scheduled_tasks` is parsed by the shared
  `parse_scheduled_tasks` first, so a malformed task array errors without touching the server.

Both tools re-sync `AppState`'s LLM client before applying, in case the update restarts the
entity. Prefer `update_server` over a second `start_server` when a server already exists;
`update_server_instruction` remains as the narrow "just the instruction" tool.

## Server teardown and state reaping

`stop_server` / `stop_all` go through `AppState::remove_server()`, which owns the
whole teardown rather than leaving half of it to the caller:

- every background task registered with `AppState::register_server_task()` is
  **aborted** (dropping a Tokio `JoinHandle` only detaches the task, so the abort is
  what releases the listening socket);
- the scheduled tasks scoped to that server — **and** to its connections — are
  cancelled.

The cleanup used to live only in the TUI's stop paths (`cleanup_server_tasks`), so the
MCP tools left orphaned tasks behind on every stop. Doing it inside `remove_server` is
what stops that recurring — no caller can forget half the teardown.

`tests/mcp_stop_cleanup_test.rs` pins this from the tool surface rather than the state
API (`tests/server_stop_cleans_scheduled_tasks_test.rs` covers the latter), so a
rewrite of `stop_server`/`stop_all` that stops routing through `remove_server` fails a
test instead of shipping. It needs to see behind the tools — a tool result is text, and
`stop_server` reports "stopped" whether or not the tasks went with it — so
`NetGetMcpService::app_state()` exposes the service's `AppState` (a clone of the `Arc`,
i.e. the live state the tools mutate).

**Scheduled tasks now fire in MCP mode.** A dedicated ticker (`spawn_task_ticker`, started from
`create_shared_state` alongside the reaper) drives `execute_due_tasks_public` on a **1s** cadence
(`TASK_TICK_INTERVAL_SECS`, matching the TUI event loop and the non-interactive runner, with
`MissedTickBehavior::Skip` so a slow batch cannot stampede catch-up ticks). So `start_server`'s
`scheduled_tasks` array and the `schedule_task` action now actually execute over both the STDIO and
HTTP transports (which share the one `SharedState`). Scoping is not re-implemented in the ticker:
`execute_due_tasks_public` reads the live task set from `AppState` each tick, so Global / Server /
Connection scoping — and the removal of server-/connection-scoped tasks by `remove_server` on
`stop_server`/`stop_all` — are honoured exactly as in the TUI; only Global tasks persist a server
stop. (Historical note: this was a known gap — tasks used to sit at `Scheduled` forever because no
loop ticked `execute_due_tasks` — and an in-code comment in `spawn_state_reaper` still says
scheduled tasks are "TUI-only here". That comment is stale; `spawn_task_ticker` is the authority.)

`register_server_task()` stores a `Vec` of handles per server, like the client side:
a protocol with two long-lived loops (a UDP listener plus a TUN reader) gets both
aborted instead of only the last-registered one.

MCP mode also runs its own **reaper** (`spawn_state_reaper`, started from
`create_shared_state`), ticking every 5s over `cleanup_old_servers`,
`cleanup_closed_connections`, `cleanup_old_connections` and
`cleanup_old_conversations`. The TUI drives these from its event loop; MCP mode has
no such loop, so without the reaper an LLM-initiated `close_server` — which marks a
server `Stopped` rather than removing it — left the entry in `AppState` forever.

## Access Logs

Every network event a protocol server handles is recorded as an `AccessLogEntry`
in a bounded ring buffer on `AppState` (last **1000**, oldest dropped). The **request**
is the structured event data (e.g. HTTP method/path/headers); the **response** is
the action JSON the LLM produced (e.g. `send_http_response`). Recording happens
centrally in `action_helper::call_llm` after the event is handled, so it works for
every protocol without per-protocol wiring.

- `list_access_logs { limit? }` — newest-first summaries (id, age, owner, protocol, request→response).
- `get_access_log { id }` — full request and response JSON for one entry.

**Clients record too, and entries carry an owner.** `AccessLogEntry` has
`server_id: Option<u32>` and `client_id: Option<u32>`, exactly one set, both
`skip_serializing_if = "Option::is_none"` — so a server entry's JSON is
byte-identical to what it always was and existing consumers are unaffected.
`AppState::list_access_logs_for(owner, limit)` filters per instance (what the
dashboard's per-band request panes use). Client entries come from
`llm_budget::call_llm_for_client` and from injected `send_to_client` actions
(event type `injected_action`).

Two limitations worth knowing: only successfully-handled events are logged — a
request whose LLM call errors out produces no entry; and a **client** entry records
the actions that were *produced*, not executed, because execution happens later
inside the client's own connection loop, which does not report back. The
`send_to_client` path is honest about outcomes via `ClientSendOutcome`.

## Startup configuration

`create_shared_state` is MCP's equivalent of the TUI's startup block, and must stay in
step with it. `--mcp` / `--mcp-http` return from `cli::run()` **before** every
`configure_rate_limiter` / `set_selected_scripting_mode` / `set_event_handler_mode` call
site, so anything the TUI or `non_interactive` applies has to be applied here too or the
flag is silently dead in headless mode. It used to build a bare `AppState::new()`, which
hard-codes `RateLimiterConfig::default()`, `ScriptingMode::On` and
`include_disabled_protocols: false` — so `--llm-max-concurrent`, `--llm-token-limit`,
`--llm-token-window`, `--env`, `--no-scripts`, `--handler` and
`--include-disabled-protocols` were all accepted and ignored, and the LLM client was built
without `with_app_state` (no token accounting) or `with_mock_config_file`.

All of those are wired now, plus the model falling back to the saved setting and `Ask`
web-search degrading to `Off` (MCP has no terminal to prompt on, same as the
non-interactive runner). `tests/mcp_startup_config_test.rs` asserts each one from the
service's `app_state()`, so a new flag that skips this path fails a test.

## LLM Backend

Protocol servers started via `start_server` are driven by NetGet's own configured
LLM client (`SharedState.llm_client`), built once from the CLI args. Three
mutually-exclusive sources:

- **Ollama** (default) - local Ollama instance, or
- **OpenAI-compatible** - when `--openai-url` / `--api-key` are provided, or
- **Agent queue** - when `--llm-agent` is set (see below).

MCP **sampling** (routing protocol-server LLM calls back to the MCP client's model
via the spec's `sampling/createMessage`) is intentionally **not** supported: that
capability is being removed from the MCP spec. Agent-LLM mode below achieves the
same "the calling agent is the model" outcome with our own tool workflow, so it is
spec-independent.

## Agent LLM Backend (`--llm-agent`)

`netget --mcp --llm-agent` builds an `OllamaClient` backed by a
`crate::llm::agent_queue::LlmRequestQueue` instead of contacting any model. Every
protocol-server LLM call (all of them — `chat_with_tools` and `generate_with_format`
route through the new `LlmBackend::Queue` arm) enqueues a request and blocks until
the calling MCP agent answers it, or until `--llm-agent-timeout` (default 300s)
elapses, at which point the call errors and the connection resets to Idle — exactly
like an Ollama/OpenAI timeout.

Wiring: the queue is created in `create_shared_state`, embedded in the queue-backed
`llm_client`, and a clone of the `Arc` is stored in `SharedState.agent_queue`.
`start_server` already copies `SharedState.llm_client` into `AppState`, so every
server produced to the queue automatically. A placeholder model (`"agent"`) is
pre-seeded so `ensure_model_selected` never reaches out to Ollama's `/api/tags`.

Agent workflow:
1. `get_next_llm_request { wait_seconds? }` — claim the next request (optionally
   long-poll). Returns the request id, the prompt (server instruction + triggering
   event), and the **available actions** — the agent must answer using only those.
2. `answer_llm_request { request_id, actions }` — `actions` is a JSON array of NetGet
   action objects (`{"type": "...", ...}`), the same shape `get_access_log` shows.
   Answered actions become native tool calls fed through the normal
   `ConversationHandler` pipeline, so validation/execution is unchanged.
3. `list_llm_requests` — outstanding requests, for monitoring.

Two notification paths (the agent picks either):
- **Long-poll** (reliable default): `get_next_llm_request(wait_seconds)` blocks
  server-side (rmcp runs each request in its own task, so it never blocks other
  tools). `wait_seconds` is capped at 120 to stay under client tool-call timeouts.
- **FIFO push** (`--llm-agent-pipe <PATH>`): the new request id is written to the
  named pipe (created if absent) on each enqueue, so an idle agent can block-read it
  (`read id < pipe`) instead of polling. Best-effort — if no reader is attached the
  non-blocking write is dropped; the long-poll tool is the source of truth.

Note: the answer must use an action offered for that event. Using an action the
event does not expose (e.g. `close_connection` on `tcp_data_received`) triggers
NetGet's unknown-action retry, which enqueues a *second* request.

## Logging

All logging goes to stderr (stdout is JSON-RPC). Status messages from protocol servers are drained to stderr with `[NETGET]` prefix.

## Limitations

- **STDIO is single-session**: one client at a time (HTTP supports many)
- **No elicitation yet**: Interactive config gathering not implemented
- **No dynamic tool list**: All tools exposed from start (no `tools/list_changed`)
- **No sampling**: protocol servers always use NetGet's own LLM backend, never the MCP client's model

## Testing

Automated in-process smoke tests (no Ollama, no real stdio) live in
`tests/mcp_stdio_test.rs` — see `tests/mcp_stdio_CLAUDE.md`. Teardown regressions are
pinned separately in `tests/mcp_stop_cleanup_test.rs`, and the hand-driving tools in
`tests/mcp_client_send_test.rs` and `tests/mcp_intercept_test.rs`. All drive the real tools over
`tokio::io::duplex`, so they are root-level test files rather than entries in
`tests/server/mod.rs` and are compiled without the mod.rs footgun.
