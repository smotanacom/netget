//! A transport that answers every request it received before it reports the end of its input.
//!
//! rmcp's serve loop stops the moment the transport's input ends, and a tool call still being
//! handled at that moment has its response dropped: the handler runs in its own task and hands
//! the response back to a loop that is no longer there. So a caller that writes its requests
//! and closes stdin, which is how a shell pipeline or a one-shot script drives `netget --mcp`,
//! got the answer to `initialize` and nothing after it.
//!
//! [`DrainOnEof`] wraps rmcp's own stdio transport. It records the id of every request it
//! receives and forgets it once a response or error with that id has been written. When the
//! input ends it reports the end only after every recorded id has been answered, bounded by
//! [`DRAIN_LIMIT`] so a call that never finishes cannot hold the process open forever.
