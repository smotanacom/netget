    ///   platform root store — on macOS that reads the system keychain through
    ///   Security.framework, which is synchronous and serialises across processes — so it
    ///   runs on `spawn_blocking` rather than parking a tokio worker.
    /// - It is kept, so requests after the first reuse the connection pool instead of
    ///   paying for a fresh TLS stack and handshake each time.
    /// - **The literal-IP resolver bypass.** `reqwest` hands the URL host to its DNS
    ///   resolver unconditionally and `hyper-util`'s `GaiResolver` does not special-case a
    ///   dotted quad, so `http://127.0.0.1:8080` performs a real `getaddrinfo`. On macOS
    ///   that goes through libinfo to mDNSResponder — one system-wide daemon, measured
    ///   blocking for **8.25 seconds** under ~100 concurrent processes. A NetGet HTTP
    ///   client is pointed at a literal IP more often than not, so this is the common case,
    ///   not the exotic one.
    ///
    /// That last point is why the cache is **keyed by host** rather than being a single
    /// process-wide client: `ClientBuilder::resolve` is a per-host override, so a single
    /// shared client cannot carry one for a host it has not been told about. The map is
    /// only ever as large as the set of hosts this process has been pointed at.
    ///
    /// The override logic mirrors `ollama_client::without_dns_for_literal_ip`, which is
    /// private and builds a client with reqwest's default TLS backend; this one keeps
    /// `use_rustls_tls()` deliberately, since native-tls on macOS is the keychain path the
    /// first bullet is about. `host_of` — the part that is easy to get wrong, and did get
    /// wrong once by leaving the port on — is shared.
