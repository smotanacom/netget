    /// - `reqwest::Client::builder().build()` sets up the rustls stack and loads the
    ///   platform root store. On macOS that reads the keychain through Security.framework,
    ///   synchronously and serialised across processes; called on the async runtime it
    ///   parks a tokio worker, which is how the `doh` client's whole runtime stalled. It
    ///   now runs on `spawn_blocking`.
    /// - A fresh client per request means a fresh connection pool per request, so every
    ///   request paid for a new TCP + TLS handshake — the opposite of what HTTP/2 is for.
    /// - **The literal-IP resolver bypass.** `reqwest` hands the URL host to its resolver
    ///   unconditionally and `hyper-util`'s `GaiResolver` does not special-case a dotted
    ///   quad, so `http://127.0.0.1:8080` performs a real `getaddrinfo` — measured at 8.25
    ///   seconds through mDNSResponder under ~100 concurrent processes. `ClientBuilder::
    ///   resolve` is a per-host override, which is why this cache is keyed by host rather
    ///   than being one process-wide client.
