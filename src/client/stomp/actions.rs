//! STOMP 1.2 client actions.
//!
//! The division of labour mirrors the server side (`src/server/stomp/`): everything
//! mechanical is Rust and is never asked of the model — frame boundaries, header escaping,
//! the `content-length`/NUL body rule, the `accept-version` handshake and the receipt that
//! makes `DISCONNECT` graceful. What the model decides is *content*: which destination to
//! subscribe to, what to publish, whether a delivered message deserves an `ACK` or a `NACK`,
//! and when the session is over.
//!
//! The codec itself is [`crate::server::stomp::frame`], reused verbatim rather than copied.
//! Its two private helpers (`decode_body`, `extra_headers`) are not reachable from here, so
//! their client-side equivalents live in this file; see `src/client/stomp/CLAUDE.md`.
