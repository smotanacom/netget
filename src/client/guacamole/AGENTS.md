# Guacamole client (of guacd)

The server's framing in the client role: NetGet asks guacd for a VNC/RDP/SSH/telnet session
and drives it.

`connect()` runs the handshake:
- `select <protocol>`, then reads `args`;
- sends `size` (startup `width`/`height`), empty `audio`/`video`, `image png jpeg`, and
  `timezone UTC`;
- sends `connect` with each named parameter taken from startup `arguments`, and the version
  answered as `VERSION_1_3_0`.

An `error` instead of `args` or `ready` fails the connect.

## The reader task

Rust answers what needs no decision:
- every `sync` is echoed back;
- every `blob` and `clipboard` stream is acked;
- drawing instructions are counted (`display_updates`), not decoded. The handler cannot see
  the screen.

It raises:
- `guacamole_ready` at the first `sync`, with the display size and name;
- `guacamole_clipboard_received` when a clipboard stream ends;
- `guacamole_error`. For example, guacd answers 519 when the VNC server is unreachable,
  after `ready`.

## Actions

- `guacamole_type`: each character pressed and released; `\n` is Return.
- `guacamole_key`: named keys, F-keys, characters, or `0x` keysyms.
- `guacamole_click`
- `guacamole_move`
- `guacamole_clipboard`
- `disconnect`: sends `disconnect`.

`actions::instructions` validates before anything is sent. A handler chain stops after 8
follow-ups.
