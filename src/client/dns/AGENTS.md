# DNS Client Implementation

## Overview

DNS (Domain Name System) client for querying DNS servers. The LLM can send DNS queries for various record types and
interpret responses to make follow-up decisions.

**Status**: Experimental (Client Protocol)
**RFC**: RFC 1035 (Domain Names), RFC 3596 (AAAA)
**Transport**: UDP (port 53)

## Library Choices

- **hickory-client** (formerly trust-dns-client) - DNS client library
    - Async DNS client with UDP transport
    - Supports all standard DNS record types (A, AAAA, MX, TXT, CNAME, NS, SOA, PTR, SRV, etc.)
    - Handles DNS protocol encoding/decoding automatically
    - Provides high-level query API with RecordType enums

**Rationale**: hickory-client (part of hickory-dns ecosystem) is the de facto standard for DNS in Rust. It provides a
robust, async-first client implementation that abstracts away the DNS wire protocol complexity. The LLM only needs to
provide semantic query parameters (domain, type) and can work with structured response data (answers with type-specific
fields).

## Architecture

### 1. Query-Response Pattern

DNS client follows a simple request-response pattern:

1. LLM sends `send_dns_query` action with domain and query type
2. Client sends UDP packet to DNS server
3. Server responds with DNS answer records
4. Client parses response into structured JSON
5. LLM receives `dns_response_received` event with answers
6. LLM can send follow-up queries based on response

### 2. Event-Driven LLM Integration

Two events trigger LLM calls:

- **`dns_connected`** - Client connected to DNS server, LLM can send initial query
- **`dns_response_received`** - Response received, LLM can analyze answers and send follow-up queries

### 3. Record Type Support

Client supports all major DNS record types with structured parsing:

- **A** - IPv4 address
- **AAAA** - IPv6 address
- **CNAME** - Canonical name (alias)
- **MX** - Mail exchange (with preference)
- **TXT** - Text records
- **NS** - Name server
- **SOA** - Start of authority
- **PTR** - Pointer (reverse DNS)
- **SRV** - Service locator

Each record type is parsed into type-specific JSON fields (e.g., MX includes `exchange` and `preference`).

### 4. Recursive vs Iterative Resolution

The `recursion_desired` parameter (default: true) controls whether the DNS server should:

- **Recursive (true)**: Server resolves the full query by contacting other servers
- **Iterative (false)**: Server only provides referrals to other servers

Note: hickory-client doesn't expose easy control over the RD (Recursion Desired) flag, so this is noted for future
enhancement.

### 5. Connection Model

DNS uses UDP, which is connectionless:

- No persistent connection state
- Each query is independent
- Client maintains a single UDP socket for all queries
- Queries can be sent concurrently (hickory-client handles this)

### 6. Action loop is iterative, not recursive (important)

`execute_dns_action` handles ONE action and *returns* whatever follow-up actions the
LLM asked for. `run_dns_actions` owns the work queue and drains it. Nothing calls
itself.

This used to be self-recursive — `execute_dns_action` awaited the LLM after a
response and then called itself for each follow-up. Each level is a separately
polled boxed future, so stack depth grew with the number of query/response rounds:
an LLM that never stopped asking for another query overflowed the stack after ~200
rounds and took the whole NetGet process down (`IMPROVEMENTS.md` item 49). With the
queue, stack depth is constant regardless of how many rounds occur.

**If you add another follow-up path here, return the actions — do not recurse.**

Convergence itself is a separate concern, handled by the per-client LLM call budget
(`src/client/llm_budget.rs`): after `NETGET_CLIENT_LLM_CALL_LIMIT` calls (default
100) `call_llm_for_client` fails instead of contacting the model, which drains the
queue and ends the session.

### 7. The conversation runs in a registered background task

`connect_with_llm_actions` spawns the connected-event LLM conversation rather than
running it inline, and registers both that task and the hickory transport driver
with `AppState::register_client_task()`. Two consequences:

- `connect()` returns as soon as the socket is up, instead of blocking until the
  LLM stops asking for queries (it previously never returned for a runaway client).
- `stop_client` / `remove_client` aborts both tasks, so the UDP socket is released
  and no further LLM calls happen.

## LLM Integration

### Available Actions

#### `send_dns_query`

Send a DNS query to the server.

**Parameters:**

- `domain` (required) - Domain name to query (e.g., "example.com")
- `query_type` (required) - Record type (A, AAAA, MX, TXT, CNAME, NS, SOA, PTR, SRV, etc.)
- `recursion_desired` (optional, default: true) - Request recursive resolution

**Example:**

```json
{
  "type": "send_dns_query",
  "domain": "example.com",
  "query_type": "A",
  "recursion_desired": true
}
```

#### `disconnect`

Disconnect from the DNS server.

**Parameters:** None

### Events

#### `dns_connected`

Triggered when client connects to DNS server.

**Parameters:**

- `remote_addr` - DNS server address

#### `dns_response_received`

Triggered when DNS response is received.

**Parameters:**

- `query_id` - DNS transaction ID
- `domain` - Domain name queried
- `query_type` - Record type queried
- `answers` - Array of answer records (structured by type)
- `response_code` - Response code (NOERROR, NXDOMAIN, SERVFAIL, etc.)

**Answer Structure Examples:**

A record:

```json
{
  "type": "A",
  "ip": "93.184.216.34",
  "ttl": 300
}
```

MX record:

```json
{
  "type": "MX",
  "exchange": "mail.example.com",
  "preference": 10,
  "ttl": 300
}
```

CNAME record:

```json
{
  "type": "CNAME",
  "target": "www.example.com",
  "ttl": 300
}
```

## Example Usage Scenarios

### Simple A Record Query

```
Instruction: "Query 8.8.8.8 for the A record of example.com"

Flow:
1. dns_connected event → LLM sends send_dns_query
2. dns_response_received → LLM sees {"type": "A", "ip": "93.184.216.34"}
3. LLM reports result to user
```

### Follow-the-CNAME

```
Instruction: "Resolve www.example.com and follow any CNAMEs"

Flow:
1. dns_connected → Query www.example.com A
2. dns_response_received → Answer is CNAME to cdn.example.com
3. LLM sends follow-up query for cdn.example.com A
4. dns_response_received → Answer is A record 192.0.2.1
5. LLM reports final IP
```

### MX Record Lookup

```
Instruction: "Find mail servers for example.com"

Flow:
1. dns_connected → Query example.com MX
2. dns_response_received → Multiple MX records with preferences
3. LLM sorts by preference and reports mail servers
```

### Reverse DNS

```
Instruction: "Do reverse DNS lookup for 8.8.8.8"

Flow:
1. dns_connected → Query 8.8.8.8.in-addr.arpa PTR
2. dns_response_received → PTR record points to dns.google
3. LLM reports hostname
```

## Known Limitations

### 1. UDP Only

- No TCP support for large responses (RFC 1035 requires TCP fallback for >512 bytes)
- No EDNS0 support for larger UDP packets
- Large responses may be truncated

### 2. No DNSSEC Validation

- DNSSEC signatures are not validated
- RRSIG, DNSKEY, DS records can be queried but not verified
- Clients must trust the DNS server

### 3. No Caching

- Client does not cache DNS responses
- Each query goes to the server (no local TTL tracking)
- LLM must manage its own caching logic if needed

### 4. Limited Recursion Control

- hickory-client doesn't expose easy RD flag control
- The `recursion_desired` parameter is accepted but may not be fully implemented
- Future enhancement needed for true iterative mode

### 5. Single Server Only

- Client connects to one DNS server
- No fallback to secondary servers
- No support for DNS server lists

### 6. No Query Pipelining

- Queries are executed sequentially in the LLM loop
- hickory-client supports concurrent queries internally
- But LLM must explicitly send multiple actions to parallelize

## Performance Characteristics

### Latency

- **DNS Query**: 10-100ms (depends on server and network)
- **LLM Processing**: 2-5 seconds per response
- **Total per query**: ~2-5 seconds

### Throughput

- **Limited by LLM**: ~0.2-0.5 queries per second
- hickory-client can handle thousands of QPS, but LLM is bottleneck
- Concurrent queries require LLM to generate multiple actions

### Scripting Compatibility

DNS is an excellent candidate for scripting:

- Deterministic query-response pattern
- Well-defined record types
- No complex state machine

With scripting enabled:

- Initial LLM call generates script (~1 call)
- All subsequent queries handled by script (~0 LLM calls)
- Dramatically improves throughput

## Implementation Details

### hickory-client Integration

```rust
// Create UDP client stream
let stream = UdpClientStream::<tokio::net::UdpSocket>::new(dns_server);
let (client, bg) = AsyncClient::connect(stream).await?;

// Spawn background task
tokio::spawn(bg);

// Send query
let response = client.query(name, DNSClass::IN, RecordType::A).await?;

// Parse answers
for answer in response.answers() {
    match answer.record_type() {
        RecordType::A => {
            if let Some(a) = answer.data().and_then(|d| d.as_a()) {
                println!("A: {}", a);
            }
        }
        // ... other types
    }
}
```

### Error Handling

- **Connection errors**: Reported as client status error
- **Query timeout**: hickory-client handles with default timeout (5 seconds)
- **NXDOMAIN/SERVFAIL**: Reported in response_code, not as error
- **Invalid domain**: Parsing error before query sent

### Memory Management

- Client holds `AsyncClient` in `Arc<Mutex<>>` for shared access
- Background task (`bg`) runs independently to handle I/O
- Each query creates a temporary future, no persistent state

## Testing Strategy

See `tests/client/dns/CLAUDE.md` for detailed testing approach.

**Test Servers:**

- Public DNS: 8.8.8.8 (Google), 1.1.1.1 (Cloudflare)
- Local test: `dnsmasq` or `unbound` in Docker container

**E2E Budget:** < 5 LLM calls

- Test 1: Simple A query (1 call)
- Test 2: CNAME follow (2 calls)
- Test 3: MX query (1 call)

## Command channel (injected actions)

The client registers a `command_support` command channel, so `AppState::send_to_client` — the
dashboard's `[ send ]` — can execute an action inside the running client. The channel is
registered **before** the `dns_connected` LLM call, which a `*` → manual routing rule can park
for minutes.

The hickory `AsyncClient` moved out of the conversation task into an `Arc<Mutex<_>>` created in
`connect_with_llm_actions`, so the command loop queries through the **same** connected resolver
the LLM path uses rather than opening one of its own.

| Action | `ClientSendOutcome` |
|---|---|
| `send_dns_query` | `Executed { detail }` — see below |
| `wait_for_more` | `Executed` |
| `disconnect` | `Disconnected`; the command loop ends and the handle is dropped |
| anything else | `Rejected { error }` |

**Why a query reports `Executed` and not `Sent`.** hickory owns the wire encoding and the UDP
socket and reports no byte count, so there is no truthful number to hand back and a `Sent{n}`
here would be invented. The detail string carries what the caller actually wants instead —
`dns_query example.com A -> NOERROR with 1 answer(s)`. A network fault during the query is an
`Err`, distinct from `Rejected`, which is reserved for the model naming a verb this client does
not have.

`execute_dns_action` is now `apply_dns_action` (run the query, no LLM) plus
`report_dns_response` (hand the answers to the model, collect follow-ups). The split lets the
command loop answer its caller as soon as the resolver replies and report to the model
afterwards, so a manual rule parked on `dns_response_received` cannot hold `[ send ]` open for
its whole timeout. Follow-up actions from an injected query still go through
`run_dns_actions`, so the iterative work queue — and the stack-overflow fix it exists for —
covers the injected path too.
