    ///
    /// - `Client::builder().build()` sets up the rustls stack and loads the platform root
    ///   store; on macOS that reads the system keychain through Security.framework,
    ///   synchronously and serialised across processes. On the async runtime it parks a tokio
    ///   worker, so it runs on `spawn_blocking` here.
    /// - Keeping it means later requests reuse the connection pool instead of paying for a
    ///   fresh TLS stack and handshake each time. "Each request creates new HTTP connection"
    ///   was listed as a limitation of this client; it was a consequence of this.
    /// - **The literal-IP resolver bypass.** `reqwest` hands the URL host to its DNS resolver
    ///   unconditionally and `hyper-util`'s `GaiResolver` does not special-case a dotted quad,
    ///   so `http://127.0.0.1:8080` performs a real `getaddrinfo` — on macOS through libinfo
    ///   to mDNSResponder, one system-wide daemon, measured blocking for 8.25 seconds under
    ///   ~100 concurrent processes. A NetGet JSON-RPC client is pointed at a literal IP more
    ///   often than not.
    ///
    /// That last point is why the cache is keyed by host rather than being one process-wide
