# Raw QUIC client

Feature `quic`, protocol `QUIC`; distinct from `HTTP3`. Default ALPN is
`netget-quic`. `alpn` can select a peer's other raw application token. The client
always verifies certificate and hostname against public WebPKI roots plus the
optional `ca_cert_path` PEM file. `server_name` overrides authentication/SNI.

`send_quic_data` opens one bidirectional stream, sends the decoded payload and
FIN, and reads until the peer's FIN. Every action opens a new stream. Payload
encoding is explicit: utf8 (default), hex or base64. Response events use utf8 for
printable ASCII and hex for other bytes. No application framing is added.
`wait_for_more` waits and `disconnect` cancels all streams and closes the endpoint.

Events `quic_connected`, `quic_data_received`, `quic_stream_error` use the standard
budgeted event dispatcher, including static/script/manual handlers, memory and
memory updates. Injected actions report completion after the wire response. A
parked handler does not block injected commands or concurrent streams.

Limits: 4 MiB encoded action text (including whitespace), rejected before decoding;
1 MiB decoded bytes per direction, 32 active exchanges and 32 event handlers, 32 actions
per result, and four exchanges per automatic chain. Resolution/handshake defaults
to 10s (range 1..60), each stream to 30s (1..300), connection idle to 300s
(1..3600). Timeouts/removal stop and reset streams. One registered owner polls all
stream and event futures, then closes its endpoint on removal. Connect returns
the actual owned local UDP socket address.

Not implemented: appending to an existing stream, incoming server streams,
unidirectional streams, DATAGRAM, reconnect, 0-RTT or a connection migration
policy. This finite request/response API is suitable for peers that end their
response with FIN; it is not an interactive append API.

Maturity: Experimental. See `tests/client/quic/AGENTS.md` for independent aioquic
1.3.0 evidence and setup. The Rust transport is quinn 0.11/rustls.
