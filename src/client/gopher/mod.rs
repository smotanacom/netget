//! Gopher (RFC 1436) client.
//!
//! # One connection per request, deliberately
//!
//! Gopher has no session. The client sends one selector line, the server answers and
//! **closes** — the close is the framing, because the reply carries no length and no content
//! type. So there is no persistent socket for this client to hold, and "browsing" means
//! opening a new connection per item.
//!
//! That is exactly what happens here: [`GopherClient::connect_with_llm_actions`] opens one
//! connection to prove the hole is reachable and to obtain the local address the `Client`
//! trait must return, then closes it. Every fetch afterwards — the model's, or one injected
//! from the dashboard — opens its own connection to whatever host and port the action names,
//! which is what lets a menu item point at a different server and still be followable.
//!
//! # Menu or document: the requesting item's type decides
//!
//! Nothing in a Gopher reply says which it is. The item type in the *request* is the only
//! signal, so `send_gopher_request` carries an `item_type` and this module reads the reply
//! according to it: `1` and `7` are parsed as menus, everything else as a document. There is
//! exactly one exception, and it is not a heuristic about content: a reply whose first line
//! is a **type-3 item** is reported as an error whatever was asked for, because type 3 is the
//! only error channel the protocol has and a server uses it to refuse any request.
//!
//! When the guess is wrong the reply is not thrown away. A menu request whose reply contains
//! no parseable menu line at all is reported as `gopher_document_received` with
//! `requested_item_type` still set, so the model can see the mismatch; a menu request whose
//! reply is *mostly* menu lines keeps the odd ones in `malformed_lines`. The reverse is not
//! attempted — a document may legitimately be full of tabs, so a document reply is never
//! re-read as a menu.
//!
//! # The follow-up chain
//!
//! Browsing is iterative by nature: fetch a menu, pick an item, fetch that, repeat. A
//! follow-up fetch that raised no event would give the model exactly one turn and then go
//! deaf, which is the `elasticsearch`/`http2` defect the root `CLAUDE.md` catalogues. So every
//! fetch raises its event and asks the model again, and the recursion is bounded by
//! [`MAX_FOLLOWUP_DEPTH`] rather than by silence. The recursive call is boxed (an `async fn`
//! that awaits itself has an infinitely-sized future) and the boxed type names `+ Send`
//! explicitly, because it is awaited inside a `tokio::spawn`.
