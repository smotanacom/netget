# FTP Client Implementation

## Overview

FTP client implementation that allows the LLM to connect to remote FTP servers, send commands, and interpret responses. The client handles the FTP control channel protocol.

## Architecture

### Control Channel Client

This implementation handles FTP control channel communication:
- Line-based request/response protocol
- Response code parsing (3-digit codes)
- Multiline response support (with `-` continuation)

### Connection Flow

1. LLM initiates connection via `open_client` action
2. Client connects to FTP server (typically port 21)
3. Server sends 220 greeting
4. LLM receives `ftp_response` event with greeting
5. LLM sends commands via `send_ftp_command` action
6. Server responses trigger `ftp_response` events
7. Session continues until QUIT or disconnect

## Library Choices

- **tokio**: Async TCP handling with `BufReader` for line-based reading
- **No external FTP library**: Manual protocol for full LLM control

## LLM Integration

### Events

| Event | Description | Parameters |
|-------|-------------|------------|
| `ftp_connected` | Connected to server | `remote_addr` |
| `ftp_response` | Response from server | `response`, `response_code` |

### Actions

| Action | Description | Parameters |
|--------|-------------|------------|
| `send_ftp_command` | Send FTP command | `command` |
| `wait_for_more` | Wait for more data | - |
| `disconnect` | Close connection | - |

### Common FTP Commands

- `USER <username>` - Set username
- `PASS <password>` - Set password
- `SYST` - Get system type
- `PWD` - Print working directory
- `CWD <path>` - Change directory
- `LIST` - List directory contents
- `RETR <file>` - Retrieve file
- `STOR <file>` - Store file
- `QUIT` - End session

## Dashboard injection (command channel)

The client registers `command_support::register_command_channel` **before** the `ftp_connected`
LLM call (a manual handler can park that call; `[ send_ftp_command ]` works throughout). Because
the read loop uses `BufReader::read_line`, which is not cancellation-safe, the channel is drained
by a separate task (playbook shape 2) that shares the `Arc<Mutex<WriteHalf>>`, registered with
`register_client_task` so stop/remove aborts it. `send_ftp_command` returns `SendData`, so the
generic `handle_stream_client_command` arm executes it; `disconnect` half-closes the write side
and the read loop's EOF path runs. The handle is removed on every loop exit. No `Custom`-result
gap. Proven with zero LLM calls in `tests/client/ftp/command_channel_test.rs`.

## State Machine

                │  LLM response complete         │ More data
                │                                ▼
                │                          ┌──────────────┐
                └──────────────────────────│ Accumulating │
                                           └──────────────┘
```

## Limitations

1. **Control Channel Only**: No passive/active mode data channel
2. **No TLS**: FTPS not supported
3. **No Binary Transfers**: Text-only interaction
4. **Synchronous Commands**: One command at a time

## Example Usage

```
User: Connect to ftp.example.com and log in as anonymous to list files

LLM Response on ftp_connected:
- wait_for_more (wait for 220 greeting)

LLM Response on ftp_response (220 greeting):
- send_ftp_command("USER anonymous")

LLM Response on ftp_response (331):
- send_ftp_command("PASS guest@example.com")

LLM Response on ftp_response (230 logged in):
- send_ftp_command("LIST")

LLM Response on ftp_response (150 opening data connection):
- wait_for_more

LLM Response on ftp_response (226 transfer complete):
- send_ftp_command("QUIT")
- disconnect
```

## Testing

Test with FTP servers:
- Local netget FTP server
- vsftpd or proftpd
- Public anonymous FTP servers

## Bounded response reading (October 2026 review)

Response lines now use `client::response_reader::read_response_line`, sharing the
existing bounded line decoder. The 64 KiB cap includes the line terminator; a partial
line at EOF is an error. Oversized or incomplete replies are not forwarded as successful
responses.
Pure decoder tests are in `tests/client_review_regression_test.rs::text_responses`.

## Response completion deadlines (October 2026 follow-up)

Shared text readers allow an idle established connection to wait for its first response byte,
then enforce a 30-second absolute line-completion deadline. Dot-terminated bodies have a
30-second whole-response deadline in addition to their byte cap. NNTP greetings are bounded
from the first wait; HTTP CONNECT has a single deadline spanning status and headers. A framing
timeout is terminal because resuming an interrupted parse would misalign the stream.
