//! WHOIS client implementation.
//!
//! **The peer here is somebody else's server, and it decides how much it says.** A WHOIS
//! reply has no length field: the server writes until it is done and then closes, so the
//! client reads until EOF. That makes "read until EOF" the protocol *and* an unbounded
//! allocation controlled entirely by the remote end — a server that streams, or simply never
//! stops, grows this process's memory for as long as it keeps sending. Both read paths are
//! therefore capped by [`MAX_RESPONSE_BYTES`] and bounded by [`RESPONSE_READ_TIMEOUT`], and
//! an over-long reply is truncated and answered rather than abandoned: the head of a WHOIS
//! record is the part with the registrar in it.
