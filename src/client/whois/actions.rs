//! WHOIS client protocol actions.
//!
//! **The two `EventType` statics below are the ones `mod.rs` emits, and `get_event_types()`
//! must return exactly them.** It used to build two *different* `EventType`s inline, with the
//! same ids but no parameters, no actions, and `{"type": "placeholder"}` as the example
//! action. Three things followed from that, and none of them fails loudly:
//!
//! * The model was shown `placeholder` as the thing to answer a `whois_connected` with. The
//!   WHOIS *server* had the identical bug and fixed it, with a comment in `actions.rs` saying
//!   the example is rendered verbatim into the documentation and so has to be executable.
//! * The parameters the client actually puts on each event — `remote_addr`, `response`,
//!   `query`, `truncated` — were documented nowhere the model could read them.
//! * `event_handlers` validation (`events::handler::action_catalog_for_pattern`) built its
//!   catalog from `get_sync_actions()` **plus the matching event's own actions**, and read
//!   `get_async_actions()` not at all. With no `.with_actions(…)` anywhere and an empty sync
//!   list, the catalog for a whois-client event was the common actions alone — so
//!   `{"type": "query_whois"}` in a static handler was rejected as an unknown action, and a
//!   whois client could not be routed deterministically at all. **That was a defect in the
//!   shared code and is fixed there**: a client's catalog is now async ∪ sync ∪ the matching
//!   events' actions, the same union the model is shown
//!   (`llm::actions::client_trait::client_action_names_for_pattern`). Attaching the two verbs
//!   to the events below is still right — the event's own list is what a reader of the docs
//!   sees as the answer to *that* event — but it is no longer what makes them nameable.
//!
//! The actions are therefore defined once, below, and attached to both events.
