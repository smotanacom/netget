//! LLMNR (RFC 4795) querier.
//!
//! LLMNR is DNS's message format on a link-local multicast group, and as a *client* it has
//! three properties that DNS does not, all of which are load-bearing here:
//!
//! 1. **A query has no single answer.** It is multicast to the link, and *every* host that
//!    claims the name replies unicast. Two hosts answering the same name with different
//!    addresses is not an edge case — LLMNR is unauthenticated, so it is precisely what name
//!    spoofing looks like on the wire. This client therefore collects for a whole window,
//!    raises one `llmnr_response_received` per responder, and raises
//!    `llmnr_conflicting_responses` loudly when they disagree. It never silently takes the
//!    first answer.
//! 2. **Nobody answering is the normal outcome.** RFC 4795 §2.1.1 has a responder stay silent
//!    for a name it does not own rather than return NXDOMAIN, so an unanswered query is how
//!    the link says "no host here claims that name". It is modelled as its own event
//!    (`llmnr_query_timeout`), not as an error.
//! 3. **The querier is the only thing that can reject a forged answer.** There is no
//!    authentication, so the transaction ID and the echoed question are the entire defence.
//!    Every datagram is matched on both and anything else is discarded with a recorded reason,
//!    which then reaches the model in the timeout event's `discard_reasons`.
//!
//! See `src/client/llmnr/CLAUDE.md` for the design notes and what is unverified.
