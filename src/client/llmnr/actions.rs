//! LLMNR (RFC 4795) **querier** actions.
//!
//! LLMNR reuses the DNS message format, so every packet is built and parsed with
//! `hickory-proto`. What differs from DNS is the header flag layout, the fact that a name is
//! answered by *however many* hosts on the link claim it, and the fact that **no answer at all
//! is the normal outcome**. All three are encoded here and explained in
//! `src/client/llmnr/CLAUDE.md`.

// Header flag mapping — the one place LLMNR genuinely departs from DNS
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// RFC 4795 §2.1.1 lays the LLMNR header word out as
// `QR|Opcode|C|TC|T|Z|Z|Z|Z|RCODE`, which is bit-for-bit RFC 1035's
// `QR|Opcode|AA|TC|RD|RA|Z|Z|Z|RCODE` with three flags renamed:
//
//   * DNS `AA` (byte 2, bit 2, 0x04) is LLMNR `C` — Conflict.
//   * DNS `RD` (byte 2, bit 0, 0x01) is LLMNR `T` — Tentative.
//   * DNS `RA` joins the Z field and MUST be zero.
//
// `hickory-proto` has no LLMNR mode, so those bits are read and written through their DNS
// names. `src/server/llmnr/actions.rs` puts the aliasing in exactly two helpers so no reader
// has to remember that `set_recursion_desired` means "tentative"; this file does the same, and
// the two must stay consistent — they are the two halves of one protocol.

/// Read the LLMNR `C` (Conflict) bit out of a parsed message.
///
/// In a *response* it means the responder has seen this name claimed by more than one host.
/// That is the responder's own opinion and is reported to the model alongside this querier's
/// independent observation of how many hosts answered.

                 both ends frame with hickory-proto, so the test shows only that one codec \

                 webrtc_signaling and websocket. The real LLMNR responders are Windows hosts \
                 and systemd-resolved, neither present on macOS. HOW TO BREAK THE CODEC AXIS: \
                 the crates.io crate `llmnr-poison` 0.1.0 IS a library (not, as the server half \

                 `llmnr_response(query: &[u8], spoof: Ipv4Addr) -> Option<(String, Vec<u8>)>` \
                 is a pure function - the test keeps its own ephemeral unicast socket and lets \
                 that crate own the encoding, which is a genuinely independent implementation. \
                 Its `poison(spoof)` entry point is NOT usable: it takes no bind address and \
                 claims the fixed port 5355 plus NBT-NS 137. Even with that wired up this stays \
                 Experimental, because an independent response ENCODER is not a running \
                 responder and nothing here has met a Windows or systemd-resolved peer. Also \
                 unverified: multicast on a real link (the tests are unicast to loopback, \
                 because loopback carries no multicast route), IPv6/FF02::1:3 entirely, and TCP \
                 queries (RFC 4795 2.4), which this querier does not implement.",
