/// * **Build it once.** `reqwest::get` built a fresh client per request.
/// * **Build it off the runtime.** `Client::builder().build()` sets up the rustls stack and
///   loads the platform root store, which on macOS reads the keychain through
///   Security.framework — synchronously, and serialised across processes. On an async worker
///   that parks the whole thread, so it goes through `spawn_blocking`.
/// * **Key it by URL.** `reqwest` hands even a dotted quad to `getaddrinfo`, which serialises
///   through mDNSResponder on macOS and was measured at 8.25s under load.
