//! Ident (RFC 1413) **client** actions, events and metadata.
//!
//! The querying half of RFC 1413. NetGet asks another host "which account owns the TCP
//! connection between these two ports?" and reads back one line. The vocabulary is
//! deliberately tiny — there is exactly one thing a client may say on the wire — and the
//! interesting work is in `mod.rs`, which owns the parse and the port-pair check.
//!
//! ## Nothing here consults the local system
//!
//! The server half's rule ("NetGet invents every userid, it never reads `/etc/passwd`") has a
//! mirror image on this side: NetGet is the *querier*, so it learns about somebody else's
//! accounts. The port pair the model asks about is the model's own choice — it is never
//! derived from a local socket table, `getpwuid`, or any other host state — and the userid
//! that comes back is reported once, in the event, and nowhere else. It is not written into
//! memory automatically, not echoed into a status line, and not used to name anything.
