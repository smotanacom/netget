//! Finger (RFC 1288) client protocol actions.
//!
//! The client's whole vocabulary is one query and two ways of ending the session. Finger's
//! answer is **free text by design** — RFC 1288 specifies no format for it at all — so nothing
//! here parses it. The text goes to the model verbatim and the model decides what it means;
//! that is the entire point of NetGet. The one concession is a small `best_effort` block on the
//! response event, and it is named that way because it is a guess: half the world's finger
//! daemons print something a `Login:`/`Name:` reader would get wrong.
