//! NetGet - LLM-Controlled Network Application
//!
//! A Rust CLI application that allows an LLM to control network protocols
//! and act as a server or client for various protocols (TCP, FTP, etc.).

// The browser build has no OS underneath. On wasm32 the names `tokio` and `crossterm` mean
// the shim crates under `crates/`: the JS event loop as executor, a virtual loopback network,
// and crossterm's key/colour types without a terminal. Binding them here, once, at the crate
// root is what lets every `tokio::spawn` and `KeyCode::Char` in the tree compile unchanged.
// See crates/netget-tokio-wasm/src/lib.rs for what is real tokio and what is not.
