//! Single dual-sink logging facade.
//!
//! Historically every call site that wanted a line in both the file log and the
//! TUI wrote the two independently: a `tracing` macro for the file, and a
//! hand-typed `status_tx.send(format!("[LEVEL] …"))` for the TUI. The `[LEVEL]`
//! bracket was a *string*, unrelated to the `tracing` level next to it, so the
//! two channels routinely disagreed on the level of the same event (see the
//! logging revamp design). There was also no level filtering on the TUI stream
//! at all — a `[TRACE]` payload reached the TUI even in a release build whose
//! file log was INFO-filtered.
//!
//! [`Log`] fixes the drift structurally: one [`Level`] value drives **both** the
//! `tracing` macro and the TUI bracket prefix, so `[INFO]` on the TUI can never
//! disagree with `info!` in the file. It also encodes the CLAUDE.md level
//! convention as routing defaults (see [`default_sink`]): payloads and summaries
//! (`TRACE`/`DEBUG`) stay file-only and off the unbounded status channel unless a
//! caller explicitly opts them in.
//!
//! This is the path the per-protocol logging sweep is meant to adopt everywhere;
//! for now it is used only on the LLM request/response path
//! (`llm::conversation`, `llm::ollama_client`).
//!
//! Note: because the `tracing` macro fires inside this module, file-log lines
//! carry `netget::logging::emit` as their target rather than the originating
//! module. Level-based `EnvFilter` (`netget=…`) still applies; only the
//! module-path breadcrumb changes.
