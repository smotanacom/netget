//! Who answers an instance's events, in one word.
//!
//! An instance's handler table can hold any number of rules, but the one
//! that decides its character is the wildcard: what happens to an event no
//! specific rule claims. That is the **driver**, and it is what the list badge
//! shows and what `[ driver: … ]` / `m` cycles. Cycling rewrites only the
//! wildcard rule; every specific rule survives.
