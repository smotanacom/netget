//! `[ view in wireshark ]` — a paste-ready capture command for one instance.
//!
//! NetGet does not write pcaps; what it can do is tell Wireshark exactly where
//! to look. Given what the dashboard already knows about an instance (its
//! protocol, the address it binds or dials, an interface for the raw-socket
//! protocols) this module derives:
//!
//! * the **interface** to listen on (loopback for local addresses, the
//!   platform's "everything" device otherwise),
//! * a **capture filter** (BPF, applied at capture time — cheap),
//! * a **display filter** (Wireshark syntax — names the dissector, so the
//!   packet list shows decoded `HTTP`/`DNS`/`MQTT` rows, not `TCP`),
//! * a `-d` **decode-as** clause, because most instances sit on a port
//!   Wireshark would not guess the protocol for (an HTTP server on 8080 is
//!   just TCP to it until told otherwise),
//! * and the `wireshark` / `tshark` command lines that put those together.
//!
//! Everything here is pure and platform-parameterised so it can be asserted in
//! tests; the only system knowledge is a table of which NetGet protocol rides
//! on which transport and what Wireshark calls its dissector. A protocol
//! missing from the table still gets a correct, if undecoded, capture.
//!
//! The form offers the same thing **before** the instance exists, so the
//! capture can be running when the first packet arrives — the whole point of
//! showing it at creation time.
