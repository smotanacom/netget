# NetGet — protocol expansion candidates (October 2026)

A survey of protocols **not yet in the tree** that fit NetGet's model (Rust owns
framing/crypto/IDs/bounds; the LLM/script/static/manual handler decides what to say),
plus the handful of existing protocols that have only one of the two roles.

The hard filter throughout is NetGet's own maturity rule: **an independent third-party
peer must exist** (a binary or a crate that is not the one NetGet frames with), or the
protocol is permanently Experimental. Every entry below names its candidate Rust library
and its independent peer, because that pair is what decides whether the item can ever
leave Experimental. Library/peer notes were spot-checked against crates.io/docs.rs in
October 2026; re-verify maintenance status before adopting.

Status of the catalogue as of this survey: **194 server registrations, 87 client
registrations**; Programme 3's 72 items are all complete. This document is the *next*
pool, not a commitment.

Priority: **A** strongest general fit · **B** useful follow-on · **C** workload-specific.
Effort **S/M/L** covers both roles plus interoperability tests.

---

## Tier A — strong fit, real peer, reasonable effort (recommend first)

| # | Protocol | Transport | Rust lib | Independent peer | Pri/Eff | Note |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **ClickHouse native TCP** | TCP 9000 | `opensrv-clickhouse` | `clickhouse-client` CLI | A/M | Mirrors `opensrv-mysql`, already a dep. The official `clickhouse` crate is HTTP/RowBinary, so NetGet's native server is distinct. Strongest DB gap. |
| 2 | **ZeroMQ / ZMTP 3.1** | TCP | `zeromq` (zmq.rs, supports `bind`) | libzmq via `pyzmq`, `zmq` CLI | A/M | REQ/REP, PUB/SUB, DEALER/ROUTER. Big messaging gap next to NATS/AMQP/MQTT. |
| 3 | **9P (9P2000.L)** | TCP / Unix | `rs9p` (tokio, async) | Linux `v9fs` mount, QEMU, `py9p` | A/M | Clean async VFS server; peer is the kernel. Rounds out the file family (SMB/NFS/FTP/WebDAV). |
| 4 | **LMTP (RFC 2033)** | TCP 24 | reuse SMTP stack | Postfix/Dovecot LMTP | A/S | Near-free given the SMTP server. Finishes the mail-delivery set. |
| 5 | **LPD (RFC 1179)** | TCP 515 | hand-rolled (trivial) | CUPS `lpd`, `lpr` | A/S | Print family companion to IPP. |
| 6 | **Classic inetd services** | TCP+UDP 7/9/13/17/19/37 | hand-rolled | `nc`, systemd/inetd socket units | A/S | Echo, Discard, Daytime, QOTD, Chargen, Time. One feature, trivial, excellent demo/test fixtures and a UDP-echo oracle. |
| 7 | **RCON + A2S + Minecraft SLP** | TCP (RCON) / UDP (A2S/SLP) | `rcon`, `a2s` (client side); hand-rolled server | `mcrcon`/`rcon-cli`, `gamedig`/`mcstatus` | A/S | Game-server family. Easy, self-contained, strong demo value. |
| 8 | **SMPP v5** | TCP 2775 | `rusmpp` (client+server, low-level) | SMPPSim, `jsmpp` | A/M | SMS/telecom; mature typed library. |
| 9 | **Cap'n Proto RPC** | TCP | `capnp-rpc` | C++ `capnp`, `pycapnp` | B/M | RPC family next to gRPC/Thrift/Connect. |
| 10 | **MessagePack-RPC** | TCP | `rmp-rpc` | **Neovim `nvim --embed`**, node/python msgpack-rpc | B/M | Free high-quality peer: Neovim speaks it natively. |
| 11 | **Zipkin span ingest** | HTTP+JSON | hand-rolled | Zipkin server, OTel exporter | B/S | Observability companion to OTLP/Prometheus/Loki. |
| 12 | **NATS JetStream** | TCP (extend `nats`) | extend existing | `nats-server` (already a build dep) | B/M | Extension of the shipped NATS core; peer is already installed. |

## Tier B — good fit, peer available, more effort or platform-bound

| Protocol | Transport | Rust lib | Independent peer | Pri/Eff | Note |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **KNX/IP** | UDP 3671 | `knust` (tunnel+routing+secure) | `knxd`, Calimero | B/M | Building automation; UDP, testable without hardware. |
| **D-Bus** | Unix (Linux) | `zbus` (pure Rust) | `dbus-daemon` + `busctl`/`gdbus` | B/M | Serve a bus name on the session/system bus. Linux-only, like the BLE/CAN items. |
| **X11 client** | TCP/Unix 6000 | `x11rb` (client bindings) | `Xvfb`/`Xorg` | B/M | Client only — a server is a large build. Xvfb is a trivial CI peer. |
| **BFD (RFC 5880)** | UDP 3784 | hand-rolled | FRR `bfdd`, BIRD | B/M | Routing family (BGP/OSPF/ISIS/RIP neighbours). |
| **VXLAN / Geneve / GRE** | UDP 4789 / IP | hand-rolled | Linux `ip link` (kernel native) | B/M | Overlay/L2, extends the Tier-1 impersonation work; kernel is the peer. |
| **WS-Discovery + ONVIF** | UDP mcast + HTTP/SOAP | `quick-xml` | `python-ws-discovery`, real IP cameras | B/M | Discovery family (SSDP/mDNS/LLMNR). |
| **Consul** | HTTP + DNS | `consul`/community | `consul agent` | B/M | KV + catalog + health; DNS half reuses the DNS server. Client maturity limited by the generic-HTTP rule. |
| **Matrix client-server API** | HTTP+JSON | `ruma` (types) | Conduit/conduwuit (Rust), Synapse, `matrix-nio` | B/L | High value, large surface; real Rust and Python peers exist. |
| **Milter** | TCP | hand-rolled | Postfix/Sendmail driving the filter, `pymilter` | B/M | Mail-filter server; MTA is the peer. |
| **Apache Guacamole protocol** | TCP/WebSocket | hand-rolled text protocol | `guacd` | B/M | Remote-access family; guacd is a clean peer. |
| **Stratum V1 / V2** | TCP | `stratum` (V1), SRI `*_sv2` (V2) | `cpuminer`, SRI | B/M | Mining/blockchain next to Bitcoin/Nostr. |
| **Anthropic Messages API** | HTTP | hand-rolled (like `openai`) | official Anthropic SDKs | B/S | AI companion to `openai`/`ollama`/`mcp`; trivial given the OpenAI server. |
| **PFCP (5G core)** | UDP 8805 | hand-rolled | Open5GS, free5GC | C/L | Telecom; UDP so testable. NGAP/N2 needs SCTP (Linux CI only). |
| **ActivityPub + WebFinger** | HTTP+JSON-LD + HTTP sigs | `activitystreams` | Mastodon, `mastodon.py` | B/L | Fediverse; HTTP-signatures are the real protocol work. |
| **IPFS / libp2p** | TCP/QUIC + noise/yamux | `rust-libp2p` (excellent) | Kubo (go-ipfs) | B/L | Large but first-class Rust stack and a strong peer. |
| **rsync protocol** | TCP 873 | hand-rolled | `rsync` | B/L | Delta-transfer algorithm is the heavy part. |
| **SunRPC / portmap** | TCP/UDP 111 | `onc-rpc`-ish | `rpcbind`/`rpcinfo` | B/M | Infra under NFS; could expose standalone. |
| **Apache Pulsar** | TCP (protobuf-framed) | `pulsar` (apache) | Pulsar standalone | C/L | Messaging. |
| **TR-069 / CWMP** | HTTP+SOAP | `quick-xml` | GenieACS | C/M | CPE management. |
| **RadSec** | TLS 2083 | extend `radius` | FreeRADIUS | B/S | RADIUS over TLS; extends shipped RADIUS. |

## Tier C — defer (recorded so they are not re-litigated)

| Protocol | Why deferred |
|---|---|
| **Kerberos KDC** | ASN.1 + session crypto, model contributes little; same rationale as the already-deferred IPMI/WinRM/DCERPC. Peers (MIT krb5, Heimdal) exist if ever revisited. |
| **SPICE / PCoIP** | Heavy binary display protocols; little LLM surface. |
| **Ethereum devp2p / RLPx** | ECIES handshake + RLP, crypto-heavy, model contributes little. |
| **SS7 / SCCP / MAP / CAMEL / H.323** | Legacy telecom, ASN.1/IDL marshalling, SCTP transport. |
| **OpenFlow** | Only dated crates (`rust_ofp` 2017); codec-heavy. Peer (Open vSwitch) exists if revisited. |
| **Profinet / EtherCAT** | Need real-time Ethernet / hardware; no viable Rust peer. |
| **M-Bus** | Weak Rust crates; mostly hardware gateways. |
| **AFP, NIS/YP, rsh/rlogin/rexec** | Obsolete; low value, insecure legacy. |
| **Zigbee / LoRaWAN radio** | Need radios. Exception: the **LoRaWAN Semtech UDP packet-forwarder** is UDP and testable against ChirpStack — promote that specific slice if IoT is wanted. |

## Existing protocols missing one role (true gaps)

Registry coverage is otherwise complete — every apparent "client-only"/"server-only"
gate is a naming pair (`dynamo`/`dynamodb`, `openid`/`openidconnect`, `saml-idp`+`saml-sp`/`saml`,
`kubernetes-server`/`kubernetes`, `proxy`/`http_proxy`, USB/BLE device profiles whose peer
is a phone or a switch). The genuinely missing **client** roles, with their peers:

| Add client for | Peer | Note |
|---|---|---|
| **mercurial** | `hg` binary | VC client next to the Hg server; `git` already has both. |
| **svn** | `svn` / `svnserve` | VC client. |
| **rtsp / rtp / hls** | `ffmpeg`/`ffprobe` (installed), VLC | Media clients; ffmpeg is already a test peer. |
| **rdp** | `xfreerdp` | Remote-desktop client (server exists). |
| **zabbix** | `zabbix_server`/`zabbix_sender` | Agent/sender client. |
| gtp, db2, snowflake, spark, yarn | peer-limited | Lower priority: no clean local independent server for most. |

## Extensions to shipped protocols (the "separated extension" tradition)

- **gRPC client-streaming / bidi** (server streaming + reflection landed as items 68).
- **SNMPv3 + traps/informs** (have v1/v2c polling).
- **CoAP observe + blockwise** (RFC 7641 / 7959).
- **DNS AXFR/IXFR zone transfer + DNSSEC/EDNS0** (declared subset today).
- **InfluxQL / Flux query** (write path landed as item 28).
- **MQTT v5 property set**, **Kafka newer API versions**, **Redis RESP3/cluster/pubsub depth**.
- **QUIC datagrams**, **WebSocket permessage-deflate**, **HTTP SSE as a first-class server**.

## Validation lever already available

`tshark` 4.x dissects most raw/binary additions and gives an independent *encode-direction*
oracle for anything without a third-party client — worth wiring as a hard-fail peer (like
`nats-server`) for ZeroMQ, 9P, SMPP, KNX, BFD, VXLAN and the inetd/UDP services.
