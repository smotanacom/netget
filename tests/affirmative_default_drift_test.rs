//! An omitted field must never read as a yes.
//!
//! `action.get("sw1").and_then(|v| v.as_u64()).unwrap_or(0x90)` is the single most dangerous
//! line shape in this repository, because every part of it looks defensive. There is a lookup,
//! there is a type check, and there is a default so nothing panics. What it actually says is
//! *when the model says nothing, approve* — and in a smartcard that is `90 00`, the status word
//! an ISO 7816 VERIFY returns when the PIN was correct.
//!
//! Programme 2 found it three times, in protocols that share no code:
//!
//! * **`nfc`** and **`usb/smartcard`** each defaulted an APDU status word to `90 00`, and each
//!   did it in *two* layers — so removing one left the other approving. An LLM that returned no
//!   `sw1`/`sw2` at all, or whose answer failed to parse into them, authenticated the card.
//! * **`oauth2`** answered token introspection `{"active": true}` for every bearer token,
//!   including one the server had never issued. Its own `CLAUDE.md` described this as a feature
//!   ("ensures the server always responds correctly").
//!
//! All three are fixed. This test exists so the fourth fails the build instead of shipping.
//!
//! # The rule
//!
//! Over every `.rs` under `src/server` and `src/client`, a `.unwrap_or(X)` / `.unwrap_or_else(||
//! X)` / `.map_or(X, ..)` is flagged when **all** of these hold:
//!
//! 1. the receiver chain traces back to a JSON lookup — `<something>.get("<key>")` or
//!    `<something>["<key>"]` — so the value is one the *model* supplied;
//! 2. the **last** such key in that chain (the innermost lookup, i.e. the field actually being
//!    unwrapped) has a segment in [`VERDICT_SEGMENTS`];
//! 3. `X` is affirmative *for that key* — see [`is_affirmative`]. Affirmativeness is per
//!    (name, literal), not per literal: `0` is success for an `error_code` and garbage for a
//!    SIP `status_code`, and `sip` says so in a comment beside its deliberate `unwrap_or(0)`.
//!
//! # Why the key vocabulary is narrow, and why the last key is the one that counts
//!
//! `unwrap_or(true)` appears 40 times in this tree, on `eof`, `on_link`, `join_multicast`,
//! `write_protect`, `incremental`, `nullable`, `use_tls`, `enable_user_plane` and the like.
//! Defaulting any of those to `true` is a product decision, not a fail-open — none of them is
//! the answer to "may this peer proceed". Flagging them would put ~40 entries in the baseline
//! that nobody would ever remove, and `startup_param_drift_test.rs` records what happens next:
//! its strict first version flagged 57 parameters and was abandoned, because a false positive
//! in a build-failing check trains people to edit the baseline instead of the code. So the
//! vocabulary is verdicts only.
//!
//! Taking the **last** key rather than the first matters as much. `item.get("status").and_then(
//! |s| s.get("replicas")).unwrap_or(0)` is a Kubernetes table cell, not a status: the value
//! being defaulted is `replicas`, and `status` is only a path segment on the way to it. An
//! earlier version of this rule took the first decision-shaped key it found anywhere in the
//! chain and reported both of `kubernetes/table.rs`'s cell helpers plus `snmp`'s `error_index`.
//!
//! **The baseline may only shrink.** The fix is to make the absence of the field a refusal:
//! `.context("send_x_response needs an explicit status_code")?`, or a fail-closed value, and
//! for a verdict the two must not share a code path — see `radius`, where nothing in
//! `actions.rs` can synthesise an Access-Accept at all.
//!
//! Run with:
//!   ./cargo-isolated.sh test --no-default-features --features tcp --test affirmative_default_drift_test

///
/// **The HTTP-status family** (`couchdb`, `dynamo`, `elasticsearch`, `hls`, `http2`,
/// `ipp`'s `http_status`, `kubernetes`, `s3`, `spark`, `sqs`, `yarn`). The model emits a
/// `<proto>_response` action and omits `status`; the peer reads `200 OK` with whatever body
/// came along. `s3` argues the case for this in a comment at the site — emitting the action at
/// all is the assertion, and the status refines it — and that argument is worth reading before
/// changing any of them. The fix where it is not deliberate is `.context("… needs an explicit
/// status")?`: a model that meant 404 and mistyped the key currently ships a 200.
///
/// **`ipp_status` → `"successful-ok"`** (three sites). IPP carries its own status independently
/// of the HTTP one, so an omitted `ipp_status` says the print job succeeded inside an HTTP 200
/// that says nothing of the sort. Fix: require it, or default to `server-error-internal-error`,
/// which is the fail-closed value IPP actually defines.
///
/// **`mqtt` `return_code` → `0`.** MQTT 3.1.1 CONNACK code 0 is *Connection Accepted*; 5 is
/// *not authorized*. A model that answered a CONNECT with an action missing `return_code`
/// admits the client. The executor already range-checks `> 5` two lines later, so the fix is
/// one line: make the field required rather than defaulted.
///
/// **`zookeeper` `error_code` → `0`** (two sites). ZooKeeper `Ok` is 0, and `mod.rs` computes
/// `is_error` from it, so an omitted error code turns a refusal into a successful reply.
// Fixed 15 Sep 2026 and removed from this list rather than re-pointed at their new lines:
// `spark`'s `status` (which was also an unchecked `as u16`, so 65736 became 200) and
// `zookeeper`'s two `error_code` sites now default to failure - 500 and `SystemError` (-1) -
// because a reply the model did not finish describing is not a success. They were caught by
// this ratchet firing on merged code whose lines had shifted, which is the shrink-only half
// doing its job in both directions at once.
