//! Turning a failed run into a *diagnosis*.
//!
//! This is the point of the whole harness. A pass rate says the model could or
//! could not drive the protocol; only the failure mode says whose fault that is.
//! Every rule below keys off a log line netget already writes, and every one
//! carries the model's **actual output** with it — because "the model got it
//! wrong" is not actionable and `{"type":"http_reply","code":200}` is.
//!
//! The ordering is most-specific-first. A model that copies a `{{event.xid}}`
//! placeholder out of an action's own example will *also* trip the executor's
//! rejection rule, and the placeholder is the diagnosis worth reporting.
