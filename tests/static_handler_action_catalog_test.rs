//! `event_handlers` validation must offer a **client** the same vocabulary the model gets,
//! and must keep holding a **server** to its narrowed one.
//!
//! `events::handler::action_catalog_for_pattern` decides, at `start_server` / `start_client`
//! time, which action names a `{"type": "static", …}` handler may use. It built that catalog
//! from `get_sync_actions()` plus the matching event types' own actions and never read
//! `get_async_actions()` — which is the same defect `client_llm_action_set` was written to fix
//! one layer over, where `call_llm_for_client` built the *model's* tool list from
//! `get_async_actions()` alone and 53 of 91 clients had an action the model could never see.
//!
//! The consequence was that a client declaring a verb async-only could not be routed
//! deterministically at all: WHOIS's own documented static-mode startup example —
//! `{"event_pattern": "whois_connected", "handler": {"type": "static", "actions":
//! [{"type": "query_whois", …}]}}` — was rejected at startup as an unknown action. Protocols
//! worked around it one at a time by repeating their async list into `get_sync_actions()`.
//!
//! The rule, and the asymmetry these tests pin:
//!
//! * **A client's catalog is the union** (`client_action_names_for_pattern` = async ∪ sync ∪
//!   the matching events' own actions). A client has one LLM entry point — `call_llm_for_client`
//!   serves both the initial instruction and every network event — so no client *can* express a
//!   narrowing, and a verb the model may use but a static handler may not is a distinction
//!   nothing in the client means.
//! * **A server's catalog stays narrowed** to sync ∪ the matching events' actions. A server has
//!   two entry points, so its async/sync split is a real statement: TCP's `close_connection`
//!   takes a `connection_id` and is a user-driven action against the server, while the verb for
//!   hanging up on the peer whose event this is, is `close_this_connection`. A handler answering
//!   an event is in the sync position and is held to the sync vocabulary. Widening it would be
//!   the tempting "fix" and is the wrong one.
