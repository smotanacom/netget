//! A server with a TCP accept loop and no **peer handle** leaves the operator holding a
//! decision they cannot act on.
//!
//! `[ message this peer ]` and `[ disconnect this peer ]` are drawn on every live peer row, and
//! `src/tui/projection.rs` enables them from `AppState::has_peer_handle` alone. Without a
//! handle both stay dim and say "this protocol cannot message a peer from here yet". That is
//! merely an absence right up until the moment it is not: a `manual` rule parks the peer's
//! event for a **human** (`src/state/intercepts.rs`, 300s by default), the dashboard flags the
//! connection `⚠ waiting for YOUR answer` — and the operator is being asked to decide about a
//! connection they cannot inspect, cannot answer out of band, and cannot hang up. Manual-first
//! is the dashboard's whole premise, so the affordance is at its least optional exactly where
//! it is missing.
//!
//! Adopting it is ~40 lines (`src/server/whois/mod.rs` is the reference), so the cost of the
//! gap is not the work. It is that nobody notices: a missing button reports nothing, fails no
//! test, and looks like a design decision.
//!
//! # The rule
//!
//! Over `src/server/*/mod.rs` and `src/server/*/*/mod.rs`, with `//` comments stripped first,
//! a protocol **runs a TCP accept loop** when its `mod.rs` contains any of
//! `TcpListener`, `accept_bounded::accept_bounded(` or `listener.accept().await` — and is not a
//! Unix-domain listener wearing the third of those (see the false-positive note). Such a
//! protocol must either call `peer_support::register_peer_channel` or appear in
//! [`NO_PEER_HANDLE_BASELINE`] with a reason.
//!
//! **The baseline may only shrink.** A protocol that gains a handle and stays listed fails the
//! test as a stale entry, so the list cannot rot in the direction that hides progress.
//!
//! # Reasons are checked, not asserted
//!
//! The usual failure of a baseline-with-comments is that the comment stops being true and
//! nothing notices — this repository has the class recorded several times over. So most
//! reasons here are a **key with a source marker**, and the test asserts the marker is still
//! present in that protocol's `mod.rs`. If `openai` stops serving through hyper, its reason
//! stops being true and the build fails, rather than the file quietly lying. The five entries
//! reviewed by hand carry [`Reason::Reviewed`] and their argument is in the table below, which
//! is the only kind of entry a reader has to take on trust.
//!
//! # Anchoring, and the measurement that made it wider
//!
//! `PROTOCOL_QUALITY.md` measured this as "13 of 32 TCP servers", anchored on the token
//! `TcpListener` in `mod.rs`. That anchor **under-reports by a factor of three**: 62 of the 92
//! TCP accept-loop servers never name the type, because they bind through
//! `accept_bounded`/`socket_helpers` or take a `listener` from a helper and only ever write
//! `listener.accept().await`. `ftp`, `smtp`, `imap`, `tcp` and `telnet` are all in that group,
//! and `tcp` and `telnet` are the two protocols the project `CLAUDE.md` names as *having* the
//! affordance. A scan anchored on one filename or one token is the recurring shape of a wrong
//! number here, so this test uses the wider rule and states the narrower figure only as
//! history.
//!
//! # False positives, measured
//!
//! The naive rule matched **94** directories, of which **2 are not TCP at all**:
//! `socket_file` and `ssh_agent` accept on a `UnixListener` and were caught by
//! `listener.accept().await`. Both are excluded explicitly — a Unix-domain listener with no
//! `TcpListener` and no `accept_bounded` is not a TCP accept loop — which is a 2.1% naive
//! false-positive rate and zero after the exclusion. A build-failing check earns nothing by
//! being approximately right: `startup_param_drift_test.rs` records what happens next, which is
//! that people edit the baseline instead of the code.
//!
//! Run with:
//!   ./cargo-isolated.sh test --no-default-features --features tcp \
//!       --test peer_handle_coverage_ratchet_test

///   nothing useful to send even if the framing were right.
/// * **`llmnr`** — declares `.connectionless()`, so `AppState::cleanup_old_connections` evicts
///   its connection rows after ten seconds of silence *by design*. A handle would be registered
///   against a row the sweep is about to remove. Its TCP reply is length-prefixed by the
///   session too, exactly as `dot`'s is.
/// * **`mysql`** — the write half is moved into `opensrv`'s `AsyncMysqlIntermediary::run_on`,
///   which owns the packet loop and the sequence numbering. Sharing it is not just awkward:
///   MySQL packets carry a sequence id, so an out-of-band write desynchronises the client even
///   if the bytes are valid.
/// * **`nfs`** — NetGet binds the public listener and relays every connection to `nfsserve` on
///   a loopback port (`src/server/nfs/guard.rs`). The handler's peer is the relay, and an
///   injected RPC record would have to carry the xid of a call the client made, which nothing
///   outside the exchange knows.
/// * **`postgresql`** — `pgwire::tokio::process_socket` takes a concrete `TcpStream` and never
///   exposes it again; `src/server/postgresql/mod.rs` already records that this is why the idle
///   watchdog aborts the task rather than sending a FATAL. The same absence of a seam is why
