//! Does a static handler with an **empty** `actions` array suppress the LLM call?
//!
//! The root `CLAUDE.md` recorded this as an unexplained observation under "Known systemic
//! issues": with `{"type":"static","actions":[]}` on a `*` pattern, a probe on the `call_llm`
//! error branch fired with a real backend error, apparently proving the model was consulted;
//! changing only that JSON to `[{"type":"wait_for_more"}]` made the probe stop firing. The
//! mechanism was never found, and every candidate was ruled out by inspection.
//!
//! **This matters well beyond one xmpp test.** `src/tui/modal/form.rs` uses exactly the
//! empty-list form for every dashboard-created client's `<proto>_connected` rule, whose entire
//! purpose is to stop the connect event parking or reaching the model. If the observation
//! generalises, that rule does nothing and every dashboard-created client sends its connect
//! event to the LLM.
//!
//! # How this answers it
//!
//! The earlier observation was indirect — a probe on an error branch, in a full-suite run,
//! under load. This asks the question directly: point NetGet at a mock model that **records
//! every call it receives**, and count.
//!
//! A zero on its own proves nothing (the harness might simply be unreachable), so the negative
//! control has to show a non-zero on the same harness. The three cases share everything except
//! the routing table:
//!
//! | case | routing | expectation |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | control | no handler at all | the model **is** called, and its answer reaches the peer |
//! | empty | `{"type":"static","actions":[]}` | the model is **not** called |
//! | wait_for_more | `{"type":"static","actions":[{"type":"wait_for_more"}]}` | the model is **not** called |
//!
//! # Why all three live in ONE test
//!
//! They used to be three `#[tokio::test]`s, and that shape is what let this file assert
//! nothing for weeks while looking mostly green.
//!
//! The control **had never passed** — not once, from the commit that introduced the file
//! (`74dbb7f4`). The cause was not the routing at all: the harness never configured a model, so
//! `ensure_model_selected` fell through to auto-selection, which was hardcoded to
//! `http://localhost:11434` and ignored the endpoint the `AppState` was built with. Every event
//! *did* reach the LLM path and then failed closed at
//! `decision=fail_closed_llm_error … error=Failed to ensure model is selected` — before any
//! request was issued to the mock. So the mock recorded zero calls in **all three** cases, for
//! two unrelated reasons, and the two that expected zero passed.
//!
//! Split across three tests, the run reads `7 passed; 1 failed` and the two headline claims are
//! green — which is precisely backwards, because a dead control makes them worthless. In one
//! test the control is a precondition: if it ever stops reaching the model, the suppression
//! claims cannot report success on their own. That is the structural lesson, and it is cheaper
//! to encode than to remember.
//!
//! The product defect is fixed (`ensure_model_selected` takes the configured endpoint) and is
//! pinned separately by `tests/model_selection_endpoint_test.rs`. This file deliberately does
//! **not** pin a model: doing so would make the control pass without the fix and hide the same
//! class of failure again.
//!
//! Run with:
//!   ./cargo-isolated.sh test --no-default-features --features tcp --test empty_static_handler_test -- --test-threads=100
