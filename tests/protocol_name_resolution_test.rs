//! Protocol name resolution must be deterministic and specificity-ordered.
//!
//! Both registries resolve a user- or LLM-supplied string to a protocol by
//! substring-matching a keyword map. That map is a `HashMap`, whose iteration
//! order is unspecified, and the matchers used to return the *first* hit — so an
//! input matching two protocols' keywords resolved to whichever the hash order
//! happened to yield, and could differ between runs, between feature sets, and
//! between builds.
//!
//! The live case: `"ssh_agent"` contains both SSH's `"ssh"` keyword and SSH
//! Agent's `"agent"` keyword. Creating an ssh_agent client through the dashboard
//! or MCP could therefore silently produce an **SSH** client instead. It surfaced
//! as `tests/client/ssh_agent/command_channel_test.rs` passing under
//! `--features bgp,ssh-agent,torrent-peer,tor` and failing under
//! `--features all-protocols` with "Missing required startup parameters for SSH
//! client" — the SSH client's error, raised for an ssh_agent request.
//!
//! The server registry had grown a hand-maintained ladder of special cases for
//! exactly this (mDNS before DNS, SNMP before SSH-Agent, PostgreSQL before MySQL,
//! the AWS services before HTTP), several of whose comments name hash order as
//! the reason. Resolution is now longest-matching-keyword-wins with a name
//! tie-break, which is specificity-ordered and identical on every run.
