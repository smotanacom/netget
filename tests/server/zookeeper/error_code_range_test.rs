//! A model-supplied `error_code` narrowed with `as i32` encoded ZooKeeper *success*.
//!
//! `4294967296 as i32` is `0`, and in this executor `is_error = error_code != 0` decides the
//! entire shape of the reply: at zero the refusal becomes a grant and a body is appended to
//! it. A model that meant NONODE or NOAUTH told the client the operation completed.
//!
//! `zookeeper_response` already refused an *absent* or non-integer `error_code` for exactly
//! this reason — but the guard asks whether the field is an integer, and `4294967296` is one.
//! It never asked whether the integer survived the narrowing.
//!
//! `xid` is the same cast on a correlation identifier. A client matches replies by xid alone,
//! so a wrapped one answers whichever request happened to carry the truncated value.
