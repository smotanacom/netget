//! The read deadlines on a real, running Bitcoin P2P server, driven from the wire.
//!
//! Before September 2026 this server accepted without limit and bounded no read in time: a peer
//! that connected and said nothing held a socket, a read task and an `AppState` row forever,
//! before any version handshake, on a server that would happily accept a hundred more.
//!
//! Two properties are asserted, and each one alone would be satisfied by a bug:
//!
//! 1. A peer that connects and **says nothing** is closed at `FIRST_BYTE_READ_TIMEOUT` (60s,
//!    Bitcoin Core's own `DEFAULT_PEER_CONNECT_TIMEOUT`), and closed *silently* — Bitcoin P2P
//!    has no message a node may send to explain a disconnect, and Core itself just drops.
//! 2. A peer that has **sent a message** survives well past that same bound. The longer bound
//!    (1800s) sits above Core's own 20-minute `TIMEOUT_INTERVAL`, so a peer this server closes
//!    is one Core would already have dropped.
//!
//! The server here is **model-free**: a zero-action static handler answers
//! `bitcoin_connection_opened` (so nothing is written on connect and the socket stays open) and
//! a `send_verack` handler answers `bitcoin_message_received`. That matters — this protocol
//! fails closed by *disconnecting*, so a server left to consult an unreachable model would drop
//! every peer instantly and this file would be measuring that instead of the deadline.
//!
//! **How this was proved to fail without the bound**: replace the `tokio::time::timeout(...)`
//! around `read_half.read(...)` in `src/server/bitcoin/mod.rs` with the bare call and the first
//! test hangs for its whole 100-second window, then fails with "still holding the socket".
//!
//! Run with:
//!   ./cargo-isolated.sh test --no-default-features --features bitcoin,tcp --test server -- bitcoin::connection_bounds --test-threads=100
