//! `curl` — the **second** independent client for the WebDAV server.
//!
//! The rest of this directory drives `reqwest_dav`. That is a genuine third-party
//! implementation, but it is **one** implementation, and a rating resting on one client is a
//! rating resting on that client's leniency. Three times in this repository a second, stricter
//! peer showed that no conformant implementation could complete a call at all — `etcd` and
//! `grpc` emitted no gRPC trailers, `mysql` offered an auth plugin MySQL 9.0 had deleted — and
//! in all three the *error* path was accidentally correct and the tests asserted on it.
//!
//! # Why curl counts here, when the root `CLAUDE.md` rules out generic HTTP clients
//!
//! That rule rules out a generic HTTP client as evidence for a protocol layered *on* HTTP —
//! `reqwest` proves an HTTP server answers, not that the protocol above it is right. The
//! qualification is that **`PROPFIND`, `MKCOL` and `COPY` are not HTTP verbs**. They are
//! defined by RFC 4918 and by nothing else; a `207 Multi-Status` is a WebDAV status; the
//! `Destination` and `Depth` headers are WebDAV headers; and a `DAV:multistatus` body is a
//! WebDAV document. curl issuing those is a WebDAV client for the layer that matters, and it
//! is what an operator reaches for when they want to see the bytes.
//!
//! What curl adds over `reqwest_dav`, concretely:
//!
//! - **The multistatus body is read as XML, not as a struct.** `reqwest_dav` deserialises into
//!   its own schema, so it sees the fields it knows about and quietly tolerates the rest. Here
//!   the body is parsed with `quick-xml`, and a body that is **not well-formed XML at all**
//!   fails — which is exactly what an under-escaped `displayname` produces, and a deserialiser
//!   fed the same bytes would fail with a vaguer error much later, if at all.
//! - **`href` percent-encoding against `displayname` XML-escaping.** One entry here is named
//!   `notes & drafts.txt`. RFC 3986 says the `href` must carry `%20` and `%26`; XML says the
//!   `displayname` must carry `&amp;` and be read back as a literal `&`. The two rules pull in
//!   opposite directions on the same string and the server has to apply each in its own place.
//! - **Verbs `reqwest_dav`'s API never issues here.** `COPY` with a `Destination` header is
//!   driven, and the model echoes the destination it was given back into the response body, so
//!   the assertion is that the header reached the model rather than that a 201 came back.
//!
//! # Non-vacuity: what was broken, and what curl's body then showed
//!
//! Verified by breaking the server and re-reading what curl received.
//!
//! 1. **`displayname` stopped being XML-escaped** (`DavResource::render` in
//!    `src/server/webdav/actions.rs`: `xml_escape(&self.name)` → `&self.name`). curl still got
//!    `207` and a body that *looked* fine to the eye, but the bare `&` makes it invalid XML.
//!    The parse failed with
//!    `Error while escaping character at range 6..18: Cannot find ';' after '&'`
//!    and the test failed there rather than on any assertion. A status-code check would have
//!    passed, and so would a `body.contains("<D:href>")` check.
//! 2. **`href` stopped being percent-encoded** (`percent_encode_path(&self.href)` →
//!    `self.href`). The document stayed well-formed, so nothing failed to parse; the href came
//!    back as `/documents/notes & drafts.txt` and the test failed naming the expected
//!    `/documents/notes%20%26%20drafts.txt`.
//!
//! Both were reverted; `git diff src/server/webdav/` is empty.
//!
//! Run with:
//!   ./cargo-isolated.sh test --no-default-features --features webdav \
//!       --test server -- server::webdav::real_client --test-threads=8
