//! End-to-end Wake-on-LAN tests: what the *server* does with a magic packet.
//!
//! The decoder itself is covered exhaustively and for free next door in `decode_test.rs`.
//! What is left, and what needs a real process and a real socket, is the three things only
//! the server can get wrong:
//!
//! 1. the decoded packet reaches the model as an event with the right fields (and a near-miss
//!    reaches it not at all — no event, no LLM call);
//! 2. **nothing is ever sent back**, and the four outcomes that are all silence on the wire —
//!    the model recognised the host, the model dropped it, the model said nothing, the LLM
//!    call failed — are told apart in the log by a `decision=` tag;
//! 3. `announce_host_awake`, the one non-standard escape hatch, is refused unless the operator
//!    turned it on.
//!
//! Every test binds 127.0.0.1 on a high port. Port 9 is the real Wake-on-LAN port and is
//! privileged, so `PrivilegedPort(9)` genuinely fires there — that declaration is protection,
//! not decoration, which is exactly why these tests must not use it.
