//! Wake-on-LAN against a real, independent third-party sender: the **`wakeonlan` Perl script**.
//!
//! # What this closes
//!
//! `src/server/wol/actions.rs` said, in as many words, that WOL is Experimental because "the
//! decoder has been validated only against packets this repository builds from the
//! specification - no third-party sender (wakeonlan, etherwake) was available to generate one".
//! `wakeonlan` is now on `PATH`, so that sentence is no longer true and this test is what makes
//! it false: the 102 bytes decoded below were assembled by a Perl script from 2000-odd that has
//! never seen NetGet, not by `magic_packet()` in the test next door.
//!
//! # What this does NOT close, and why WOL stays Experimental
//!
//! **Wake-on-LAN has no reply.** A magic packet is one datagram in one direction; the protocol
//! defines nothing to send back, and `wakeonlan` exits without reading. So this exercise can
//! only ever show that NetGet's *decoder* accepts a real sender's bytes — there is no session,
//! no round trip, and nothing NetGet emits that a third-party implementation ever inspects.
//!
//! That is a **codec test with a real generator**, not "works against real clients", and the
//! difference matters in the direction that bites: a decoder that is wrong by being too
//! *permissive* passes this test and every other test in this directory. `rss` was promoted on
//! a superficially similar argument — "fetch-and-parse *is* the protocol, so an independent
//! reader is the strongest evidence the protocol admits" — but there the independent
//! implementation was reading **NetGet's output**. Here it writes NetGet's input, and nothing
//! third-party ever judges anything NetGet produced. See `src/server/wol/CLAUDE.md`.
