//! The `decision=` tag on the one terminal outcome this profile decides for itself.
//!
//! # Why this is a unit-shaped test and not an end-to-end one
//!
//! This profile is a thin wrapper: it prepends a sentence describing the Heart Rate Service
//! (0x180D) and hands everything to `BluetoothBle::spawn_with_llm_actions`. Once the radio is
//! up, the base stack owns the event loop, so every `decision=` a read, write or subscribe
//! produces is emitted in `src/server/bluetooth_ble/mod.rs` against `BluetoothBleProtocol` —
//! including the ATT Unlikely Error (0x0E) the base replies with when a handler fails. There is
//! nothing in this profile for an end-to-end test to reach on that path.
//!
//! What the profile *does* own is the failure of the radio itself, and that path cannot be
//! driven deterministically from a test: on a machine with a working Bluetooth adapter it
//! succeeds, and on one without it fails. So the decision text is exercised directly, which is
//! the shape `tests/server/bluetooth_ble_beacon/llm_failure_test.rs` already uses for the same
//! reason.
