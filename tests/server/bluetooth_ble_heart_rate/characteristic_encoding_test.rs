//! `encode_heart_rate` against the Bluetooth SIG Heart Rate Service layout.
//!
//! Heart Rate Measurement (0x2A37) is a mandatory 8-bit Flags octet followed by the measurement
//! value, and **flags bit 0 selects the value's type**: 0 for a one-octet `uint8`, 1 for a
//! two-octet little-endian `uint16` (Heart Rate Service 1.0, section 3.1). The bit and the width
//! have to agree, which is why the encoder chooses them together rather than taking the bit from
//! its caller.
//!
//! No Bluetooth adapter needed, so this is not ignored.
