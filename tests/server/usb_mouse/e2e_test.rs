//! E2E tests for the USB HID mouse server.
//!
//! The question these answer: *the model says "move right and click" — do the 4-byte reports a
//! host reads off the interrupt endpoint say that?*
//!
//! They drive a real USB/IP client over TCP (`tests/helpers/usbip_client.rs`): `OP_REQ_IMPORT`,
//! then interrupt transfers on endpoint 1. At the USB/IP layer an interrupt transfer is
//! indistinguishable from a bulk one — both are `USBIP_CMD_SUBMIT` carrying an endpoint
//! *number* — so `bulk_in` drives the HID endpoint. Reports are decoded here against the
//! boot-protocol mouse layout (buttons, dx, dy, wheel), not against netget's encoder.
//!
//! **What this does not prove.** There is no `vhci-hcd` and no `/dev/input/eventX`; macOS has no
//! USB/IP client. A passing run means netget emits the right HID reports for the model's
//! actions, not that a pointer moves on a Linux desktop.
//!
//! ## What this file replaced
//!
//! Seven tests that opened a bare `TcpStream` and asserted only that a mock rule fired. They
//! passed while the protocol did **nothing at all**: `handle_connection` took the accepted
//! socket as `_stream` and dropped it, never ran a USB/IP session, logged
//! "NOT YET FUNCTIONAL - waiting for usbip crate mouse support", and parked on
//! `sleep(u64::MAX)`; and every action in `actions.rs` parsed its parameters, logged
//! "not yet implemented", and returned `NoAction`. A suite that never enumerates the device
//! cannot tell that apart from a working mouse.
