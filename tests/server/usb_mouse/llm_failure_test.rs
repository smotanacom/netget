//! What a HID host gets when the LLM backend fails: nothing, on purpose.
//!
//! The failure is forced by configuring a mock for the *startup* instruction only. The
//! `usb_mouse_attached` event then matches no rule, the mock Ollama server answers HTTP 500, and
//! `call_llm` returns `Err` — the same shape as a real backend outage.
//!
//! ## Why silence is the right answer here, unlike everywhere else in this sweep
//!
//! A HID mouse owes the host no reply. The host polls the interrupt IN endpoint and is NAKed
//! whenever the pointer is not moving, which is what every mouse does most of the time. There is
//! no HID vocabulary for "the device's brain is unreachable" — STALLing the endpoint is a fault
//! that makes a host reset or unbind the device rather than a refusal it can act on, and `usbip`
//! cannot express it anyway (an `Err` from `handle_urb` aborts the session for the whole
//! device).
//!
//! What must hold is the other direction, and this test pins it: a failed LLM call must never
//! move the pointer or press a button. A phantom click during an outage would be considerably
//! worse than a pointer that does not move. The failure is dual-logged at ERROR so an operator
//! can tell a stalled model from a mouse nobody is using.
