//! The read deadlines on a real, running USB mouse server, driven from a raw socket.
//!
//! The mechanics and the full argument are in `tests/helpers/usbip_bounds.rs`, because all six
//! USB servers hand their socket to the same screen (`src/server/usb/guard.rs`) and there is
//! exactly one place in the process that reads from it. This file supplies what is specific to
//! USB mouse: its registry name, and the sentence below.
//!
//! A boot-protocol mouse is the same shape as the keyboard: reports flow only when the host
//! asks, and the device answers out of state it already holds, so no reply ever waits on a model
//! call that the idle bound could time out from under.
//!
//! Run with:
//!   ./cargo-isolated.sh test --no-default-features --features usb-mouse --test server -- \
//!       usb_mouse::connection_bounds --test-threads=100
