//! The read deadlines on a real, running XMPP server, driven from a raw socket.
//!
//! **A peer that has connected and said nothing must eventually be let go of.** RFC 6120 §4.2
//! puts the opening stream header on the initiating entity, so a peer that has sent nothing has
//! begun no stream — and nothing else in the process closes that socket, which holds a task, an
//! `AppState` row and one of `MAX_CONNECTIONS` slots pre-authentication. Remove the deadline
//! around `read_half.read(&mut temp_buf)` in `src/server/xmpp/mod.rs` and the first test hangs
//! until its own window expires.
//!
//! **Once the server has answered, the *idle* bound governs.** The second test sends a stream
//! header, gets one back from a static routing rule — so no model is involved — and then goes
//! quiet, with the two bounds set far apart and the wrong way round: a read loop that never
//! switched would hold the connection for 60 seconds and time the assertion out. The switch is
//! `stream_opened`, which is set the moment this server writes its first byte, and that is the
//! honest definition of an established stream on a server whose opening tag *is* the answer to
//! the peer's first event.
//!
//! The values here are overrides, not the defaults. The shipped defaults are 30 seconds and 900
//! (argued beside `FIRST_BYTE_READ_TIMEOUT` and `IDLE_BETWEEN_STANZAS_TIMEOUT`), and a test that
//! asserted them by waiting them out would be the slowest thing in the suite. That is why both
//! are declared startup parameters: what is asserted here is that each parameter is read and
//! applied to the read it names; the *values* are argued where they are declared.
//!
//! No mock backend: the LLM endpoint is a dead port. Loopback only.
//!
//! Run with:
//!   ./cargo-isolated.sh test --no-default-features --features xmpp --test server -- \
//!       xmpp::connection_bounds --test-threads=100
