//! A `{N}` literal whose count disagrees with what follows is refused, not relayed.
//!
//! `send_imap_response`'s `response` field relays a **pre-framed, model-authored** response
//! straight to the socket, and nothing checked its framing. RFC 3501 §4.3 makes a client read
//! *exactly* the declared number of octets, so a wrong count desynchronises the connection
//! **permanently**: the client swallows the start of the next line as message body, reads the
//! remainder as a response it cannot parse, and every tag after that is off by the difference.
//! There is no recovery, and no error the server can send afterwards that the client will
//! understand.
//!
//! It is also invisible to the assertions a test naturally writes. `tests/server/imap/test.rs`
//! carried `{50}` over a 46-octet body and passed for as long as it existed, because every
//! assertion there is `line.contains("FETCH")` on a **trimmed** string — and trimming discards
//! precisely the framing the RFC cares about. The pcap oracle found it by handing the raw bytes
//! to Wireshark's dissector. The fixture was corrected; this file is the other half, on our
//! side of the socket, so a model that miscounts is refused rather than obeyed.
//!
//! **Both directions are asserted.** A guard that refused every literal would satisfy the
//! mismatch cases alone, so the correct fixture — the real 46-octet FETCH the suite sends — is
//! asserted to still pass, byte for byte, along with the two-attribute form where the literal
//! is followed by a space rather than a paren.
//!
//! Run with:
//!   ./cargo-isolated.sh test --no-default-features --features imap \
//!       --test server -- imap::literal_framing --test-threads=100
