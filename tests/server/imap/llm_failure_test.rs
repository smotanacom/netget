//! What an IMAP client gets when the LLM backend fails: a refusal, never silence.
//!
//! Two places can fail and both used to write nothing:
//!
//! * the greeting, where the client is blocked reading a banner before it may send anything at
//!   all. RFC 3501 §7.1.5 lets a server refuse a connection with an untagged `BYE`, so that is
//!   what goes out, followed by a close.
//! * any command afterwards - answered `NO` with the tag echoed, so the client can correlate
//!   it with the command it sent.
//!
//! `NO`, not `BAD`. `BAD` means "I did not understand that command", which invites a client to
//! stop using it permanently; a backend failure is a refusal to run a command that was
//! perfectly well formed. And neither is `OK`: the LOGIN case below is the one that matters,
//! because an `OK` there would authenticate a session during an outage.
