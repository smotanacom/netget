//! The read deadlines on a real, running IMAP server, driven from the wire.
//!
//! Before September 2026 this server accepted without limit and bounded no read in time: a peer
//! that connected, took the greeting and said nothing held a socket, a connection task, a
//! peer-command channel and an `AppState` entry forever, before any `LOGIN`, on a server that
//! would happily accept a hundred more.
//!
//! Two properties are asserted, and each one alone would be satisfied by a bug:
//!
//! 1. A greeted peer that **says nothing** is closed at `FIRST_COMMAND_READ_TIMEOUT`, with an
//!    untagged `BYE` rather than a silent drop.
//! 2. A peer that **has issued a command** survives well past that same bound. The longer bound
//!    (`IDLE_BETWEEN_COMMANDS_TIMEOUT`, 2100s) exists for `IDLE`: RFC 2177 lets a client sit
//!    silent, waiting for the *server* to speak, and only requires it to re-issue at least every
//!    29 minutes. Collapsing the two numbers into one would disconnect every idling mail client.
//!
//! Both servers here are **model-free**: static `event_handlers` answer the greeting and the
//! commands, so nothing in this file depends on an LLM being reachable, and what is measured is
//! the deadline rather than a backend.
//!
//! **How this was proved to fail without the bound**: replace the `tokio::time::timeout(...)`
//! around `read_bounded_line(...)` in `src/server/imap/mod.rs` with the bare call and the first
//! test hangs for its whole 100-second window, then fails with "still holding the socket".
//!
//! Run with:
//!   ./cargo-isolated.sh test --no-default-features --features imap,tcp --test server -- imap::connection_bounds --test-threads=100
