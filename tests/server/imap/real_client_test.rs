//! python3's stdlib `imaplib` — the **second** independent client for the IMAP server.
//!
//! The rest of this directory drives `async-imap`. That is a genuine third-party
//! implementation, but it is **one** implementation, and a rating resting on one client is a
//! rating resting on that client's leniency. Three times in this repository a second, stricter
//! peer showed that no conformant implementation could complete a session at all — `etcd` and
//! `grpc` emitted no gRPC trailers, `mysql` offered an auth plugin MySQL 9.0 had deleted — and
//! in every one of those the *error* path was accidentally correct and the tests asserted on
//! the error path.
//!
//! `imaplib` needs no install: it is in the Python standard library, it is C-free Python
//! sharing no line of code with `async-imap`, and it is what an operator reaches for when they
//! want to know whether a mail server actually works.
//!
//! # What `imaplib` adds over `async-imap`
//!
//! - **The literal byte count.** `imaplib` reads a `{n}` literal by reading *exactly* `n` bytes
//!   off the socket and then resuming line parsing. A count that is wrong by one desynchronises
//!   the whole connection — every later response is read from the middle of the previous one.
//!   The message body below deliberately contains multi-byte UTF-8 (`ü`, `ß`, an em dash), so
//!   `n` is a *byte* count and not a character count, which is the mistake the encoder could
//!   make and a `String`-oriented client would never notice.
//! - **The untagged responses a command is *defined* to carry.** `imaplib.select()` returns
//!   `self.untagged_responses.get('EXISTS', [None])` — the count, not the tagged line. A SELECT
//!   that omitted `* n EXISTS` would still complete with `OK` and `async-imap` would still be
//!   satisfied; `imaplib` hands back `[None]`.
//! - **The CAPABILITY command, not just the greeting's capability code.** `imaplib.__init__`
//!   issues a real `CAPABILITY` after reading the greeting and refuses to proceed unless
//!   `IMAP4REV1` is in the answer (`server not IMAP4 compliant`).
//! - **Its own tag sequence.** `imaplib` generates `AAAA1`, `AAAA2`, … and matches completions
//!   by tag. Echoing the client's tag is therefore load-bearing, and it is read back here as
//!   the prefix of every parsed response.
//!
//! # Non-vacuity: what was broken, and what the client then reported
//!
//! Verified by breaking the server and watching `imaplib`'s own output change.
//!
//! 1. **The literal count made a character count.** In `execute_send_imap_fetch`
//!    (`src/server/imap/actions.rs`), `body.len()` → `body.chars().count()`. The body's three
//!    multi-byte characters make that four bytes short (146 → 142), so `imaplib` read four
//!    bytes too few and resumed line parsing inside the message. The FETCH still completed
//!    `OK` — the *tagged* line was fine — but the untagged response never registered as a
//!    FETCH, so `m.fetch(...)` returned `('OK', [None])` and the test failed with
//!    `imaplib did not read a literal at all … It returned: [Null]`. Note which half was
//!    still correct: the completion, which is what a test asserting only on `typ == 'OK'`
//!    would have looked at.
//! 2. **The `* n EXISTS` line removed** from `execute_send_imap_select`. The SELECT still
//!    completed `OK`, nothing on the wire was malformed, and `imaplib.select()` returned
//!    `('OK', [None])` — the test failed naming the missing count.
//!
//! Both were reverted; `git diff src/server/imap/` is empty.
//!
//! Run with:
//!   ./cargo-isolated.sh test --no-default-features --features imap \
//!       --test server -- server::imap::real_client --test-threads=8
