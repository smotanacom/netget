//! The real `kdig` binary — Knot DNS, a C implementation — against NetGet's DoT server.
//!
//! # Why this test exists
//!
//! `dot`'s Beta rating rested on `rustls` completing the handshake and on **hickory-proto**
//! assembling and decoding the DNS message. hickory-proto is the codec the server encodes with,
//! so that half was circular: the test proved our encoder agrees with our decoder. The
//! protocol's own `e2e_testing` said so, and named what would close it:
//!
//! > What is NOT proved: a third-party DoT client completing a session - kdig +tls
//! > (knot-dnsutils) is the one to reach for, and is not installed on this machine.
//!
//! It is installed now. This session has twice seen what a second, stricter client finds:
//! `etcd` and `grpc` were each Beta on one lenient peer, and in both cases **no conformant
//! implementation could complete a successful call** while every existing test passed.
//!
//! # What kdig checks that our own codec cannot
//!
//! kdig is a resolver, not a decoder. It matches the reply's transaction id against the one it
//! chose, checks the question section echoes what it asked, decodes the RFC 7858 two-byte length
//! prefix, and renders the answer through its own presentation-format writer. A reply that our
//! encoder and decoder happen to agree on but that is wrong on the wire fails here.
//!
//! Everything binds to 127.0.0.1; the certificate is self-signed, and plain `+tls` does not
//! authenticate it (validation needs `+tls-ca`, `+tls-hostname` or `+tls-pin`), which is what
//! lets the test run without provisioning a CA.
