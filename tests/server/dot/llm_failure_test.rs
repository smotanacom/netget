//! What a DoT resolver gets when the LLM backend fails: SERVFAIL, not silence.
//!
//! DoT is DNS, and the plain-DNS reasoning applies with extra force. A stub resolver blocks on
//! the answer and, getting nothing, burns its full per-server timeout before trying anywhere
//! else - and here that timeout is more expensive still, because a TLS connection is costly
//! enough that resolvers pin one and serialise queries over it, so one unanswered query delays
//! everything behind it.
//!
//! The reply has to echo the transaction id and the question section. Without them a stub
//! resolver discards the packet as unsolicited and the client is back to waiting, so a
//! SERVFAIL that fails those two checks is worth exactly as much as silence - which is why
//! this test asserts them rather than just the response code.
