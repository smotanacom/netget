//! The connection cap on a real, running DoT server, driven from the wire.
//!
//! `TLS_HANDSHAKE_TIMEOUT` (10s) and `IDLE_READ_TIMEOUT` (300s) bound how long *one* peer holds
//! a connection. Neither says anything about how many such peers there may be, and until
//! September 2026 this accept loop admitted every connection offered to it — so five minutes
//! multiplied by an unbounded arrival rate was not a bound at all. DoT is the transport a
//! resolver pins and reuses, so every one of those connections is a live TLS session with its
//! own key material and buffers.
//!
//! Three claims:
//!
//! 1. `MAX_CONNECTIONS` peers are admitted — and here they are admitted *properly*, each
//!    completing a real TLS handshake. That is not decoration: a peer that merely opens a
//!    socket is evicted by `TLS_HANDSHAKE_TIMEOUT` after ten seconds, which would free slots on
//!    its own and let claim 3 below pass for a reason that has nothing to do with the permit.
//!    Handshaking moves the held connections onto the 300-second idle bound instead, so nothing
//!    but the cap explains what this test measures.
//! 2. The next one is closed **with nothing written**, and that is the right answer rather than
//!    a shortcut. RFC 7858 puts the whole DNS exchange inside the TLS session, so a DNS message
//!    written to this socket is not a SERVFAIL — it is a malformed TLS record, and the client
//!    reports a handshake failure rather than a busy server. Refusing *inside* TLS would mean
//!    completing a handshake in order to say no, which hands a stranger a certificate signature
//!    per refused connection, and TLS itself has no alert meaning "at capacity" (RFC 8446 §6.2).
//!    So the assertion is exactly "the handshake does not complete, promptly".
//! 3. Closing an admitted connection **frees exactly one slot**. A permit dropped before the
//!    connection ends un-caps the server silently; one never released wedges it shut after
//!    `MAX_CONNECTIONS` peers have ever connected.
//!
//! **How this was proved to fail without the cap**: replace the `accept_bounded` call in
//! `src/server/dot/mod.rs` with a bare `listener.accept().await` (and drop the permit from the
//! connection task). The over-cap peer's handshake then succeeds and the test fails on the
//! assertion that it must not.
//!
//! The server is model-free: an empty instruction really is model-free, where `None` is
//! replaced by a default one. No query is ever sent, so no model call is provoked. Loopback
//! only.
//!
//! Run with:
//!   ./cargo-isolated.sh test --no-default-features --features dot --test server -- dot::connection_bounds --test-threads=100
