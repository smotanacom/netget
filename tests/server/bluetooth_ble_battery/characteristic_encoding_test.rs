//! `encode_battery_level` against the Bluetooth SIG Battery Service layout.
//!
//! Battery Level (0x2A19) is a single `uint8` carrying a **percentage**; Battery Service 1.0
//! section 3.1 defines 0 to 100 and reserves every other value. That makes it the one field where
//! clamping is least survivable: every out-of-range input lands on a perfectly ordinary reading,
//! so a caller's obvious mistake becomes an unfalsifiable claim about a device's charge.
//!
//! No Bluetooth adapter needed, so this is not ignored.
