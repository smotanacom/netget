//! What an HTTP/2 client gets when netget cannot, or will not, answer.
//!
//! The HTTP/1.1 equivalent (`tests/server/http/failure_semantics_test.rs`) is the one root
//! `CLAUDE.md` tells other protocols to copy. HTTP/2 answered a flat 500 for both an
//! overloaded backend and a broken one, and read `default_response` nowhere despite
//! advertising it as a startup parameter. These tests pin the corrected behaviour.
//!
//! As on HTTP/1.1, the assertion that the failure body carries a *category* and not the
//! error text is doing as much work as the status assertion: the backend URL, the model
//! name, netget's own retry text and `anyhow` context chains all reached the wire in ~25
//! protocols at once, because each one was written by copying its neighbour.
