//! HTTP/2's connection bounds, driven from the wire.
//!
//! `src/server/http2/h2_server.rs` declares four numbers and argues each beside itself:
//! `FIRST_BYTE_READ_TIMEOUT` (30s), `HANDSHAKE_TIMEOUT` (30s), `IDLE_BETWEEN_REQUESTS_TIMEOUT`
//! (300s) and `MAX_CONNECTIONS` (128). The two read bounds are declared startup parameters
//! (`first_byte_timeout_secs`, `idle_timeout_secs`), so these tests set them short; what is
//! asserted is that each is applied to the state it names, not the default values.
//!
//! Four claims, from the peer's side:
//!
//! * **A peer that connects and says nothing is closed at the first-byte bound.** A `peek` with
//!   a deadline before rustls or `h2` sees the socket. Remove it and the first test hangs until
//!   its own window expires: nothing else in the process closes that socket.
//! * **An established connection that carries no request is closed at the idle bound, with a
//!   GOAWAY.** An `h2` client completes the preface and one request, then goes quiet; the
//!   connection must end on the short idle bound and not on the long first-byte one. Remove the
//!   `watch_idle` arm and it lives forever.
//! * **A connection whose answer is parked for a human is not closed**, however far past the
//!   idle bound. Every stream's task holds `ConnectionActivity` busy, and this is what stops the
//!   second claim being satisfiable by a server that hangs up on everybody. Remove the `busy()`
//!   guard and the connection is closed under the parked request.
//! * **The connection past `MAX_CONNECTIONS` is refused with an HTTP/1.1 503, and closing one
//!   admitted connection frees exactly one slot.**
//!
//! No mock backend: the LLM endpoint is a dead port and every rule is static or manual. Loopback
//! only.
//!
//! Run with:
//!   ./cargo-isolated.sh test --no-default-features --features http2 --test server -- \
//!       http2::connection_bounds --test-threads=100
