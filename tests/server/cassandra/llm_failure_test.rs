//! What a CQL client gets when the LLM backend fails: a native-protocol ERROR frame.
//!
//! All six of Cassandra's LLM entry points - STARTUP, OPTIONS, QUERY, PREPARE, EXECUTE and
//! AUTH_RESPONSE - propagated the error with `?`, which dropped the connection with nothing
//! written. A driver blocks on the response to every request it sends, so that read as a
//! network fault rather than a server error.
//!
//! ERROR is the protocol's own answer. It matters that it is not a RESULT frame: an empty
//! Rows result is a perfectly ordinary CQL answer meaning "no rows matched", so a failure that
//! produced one would be a statement about the data.
//!
//! 0x0000 is "Server error"; 0x1001 "Overloaded" is reserved for capacity exhaustion, which
//! every driver already treats as retryable. Deliberately *not* 0x0100 "Bad credentials" on
//! the AUTH_RESPONSE path - the credentials were never looked at, and saying they were bad
//! would stop a driver retrying with correct ones.
//!
//! The frame here is built and decoded against the native protocol v4 spec rather than with
//! the `scylla` driver, because a driver cannot be got as far as a session without answering
//! its whole startup conversation, and the assertion is about a specific opcode and a specific
//! four-byte code.
