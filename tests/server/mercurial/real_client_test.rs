//! Mercurial against the real `hg` client (7.2.4).
//!
//! # What this proves, and what it deliberately does not
//!
//! `tests/server/mercurial/e2e_test.rs` drives every path with `reqwest`, which the root
//! `CLAUDE.md` rules out as evidence on its own: a generic HTTP client proves an HTTP server
//! answered, not that the protocol layered on top is right. This test replaces the client with
//! the real thing for the one exchange the server can actually complete.
//!
//! `hg debugcapabilities <url>` runs Mercurial's **wire-protocol handshake**:
//! `httppeer.performhandshake` issues `?cmd=capabilities`, requires the reply to carry a
//! `Content-Type: application/mercurial-*` (`parsev1commandresponse`), and parses the
//! whitespace-separated capability list into a peer object. That is a real client applying real
//! protocol rules to our bytes — notably the content type, which no `reqwest` assertion in this
//! tree checks and which is the thing that makes `hg` treat us as a Mercurial repository at all
//! rather than as a web page.
//!
//! **It is not a clone, and it is not `hg id`, and those are not achievable against this
//! server.** See the module-level note in `real_client_ceiling` below — the reason is recorded
//! there because it is the reason this protocol is not promoted.
//!
//! # Not circular
//!
//! `src/server/mercurial/` is hand-written over NetGet's own HTTP layer and links no Mercurial
//! library (`Cargo.toml`: `mercurial = ["http", "urlencoding"]`). `hg` is a Python program.

/// Why `hg clone` and `hg id` cannot be tested here, recorded where somebody will find it.
///
/// Measured against the installed `hg` 7.2.4:
///
/// * **`hg id`** aborts with `cannot look up remote revision; remote repository does not
///   support the 'lookup' capability` — after the capabilities request and before any second
///   request. `wireprotov1peer.lookup` begins `self.requirecap(b'lookup', …)`, and
///   `sanitize_capabilities` in `src/server/mercurial/actions.rs` **discards whatever the model
///   returns and substitutes the constant `["branchmap", "getbundle", "listkeys"]`**, so
///   `lookup` cannot be advertised at all. `?cmd=lookup` is also a 404.
/// * **`hg clone`** gets one step further and dies in discovery: because `getbundle` *is*
///   advertised, `setdiscovery.findcommonheads` issues `heads` **and `known`** — and `known` is
///   not capability-gated, so there is no way to opt out of being asked. NetGet 404s it.
///
/// So the protocol implements only the front of the wire protocol. That is the `openvpn`
/// situation the root `CLAUDE.md` describes: a real-client test that passes, is not ignored and
/// hard-fails when the binary is missing, and **still** does not justify Beta, because no real
/// client can use the server for the thing the protocol exists to do.
