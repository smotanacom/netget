//! The first-byte deadline on a real, running Mercurial HTTP server, driven from the wire.
//!
//! Before September 2026 this server accepted without limit and bounded no read in time: a peer
//! that connected and said nothing held a socket, a connection task and an `AppState` entry
//! forever, pre-authentication, on a server that would happily accept a hundred more.
//!
//! Two properties are asserted here, and each one alone would be satisfied by a bug:
//!
//! 1. A peer that connects and **says nothing** is closed at `FIRST_BYTE_READ_TIMEOUT`.
//! 2. A peer that **speaks** is served, and survives well past that same bound — the deadline
//!    is on the silence, not on the connection. An `hg clone` is a sequence of commands on one
//!    keep-alive connection, so a single number applied to both would break a working client.
//!
//! **How this was proved to fail without the bound**: delete the `tokio::time::timeout(...)`
//! around `stream.peek(...)` in `src/server/mercurial/mod.rs` and the first test hangs for its
//! whole 70-second window and then fails with "still holding the socket".
//!
//! The idle-between-commands bound is 900s, which no test can sit out. What is testable about
//! it — that a connection with work in flight is never reported as idle — is covered by
//! `tests/accept_bounded_test.rs` against the shared `ConnectionActivity`, and the wiring by
//! `tests/tcp_server_bounds_ratchet_test.rs`.
//!
//! Run with:
//!   ./cargo-isolated.sh test --no-default-features --features mercurial --test server -- mercurial::connection_bounds --test-threads=100
