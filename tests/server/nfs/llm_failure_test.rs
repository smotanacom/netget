//! What an NFS client gets when the LLM backend fails.
//!
//! The failure is forced the same way `tests/server/dns/llm_failure_test.rs` forces it: a mock
//! is configured for the *startup* instruction only, so the `nfs_operation` event matches no
//! rule, the mock Ollama server answers HTTP 500, and `consult_llm` returns `Err` — the same
//! shape as a real backend outage, an overload, or a malformed model response.
//!
//! Every NFS procedure in `LlmNfsFileSystem` used to answer that with `NFS3ERR_IO`, and every
//! *no-usable-action* response with the operation's own definite status — `NFS3ERR_NOENT` for
//! `lookup`, `NFS3ERR_ACCES` for `write`. Both are lies of a kind the client acts on: NOENT
//! tells it the file does not exist, when in truth the server never managed to ask. RFC 1813
//! has a status for precisely this case, `NFS3ERR_SERVERFAULT` (10006), "an error occurred on
//! the server which does not map to any of the legal NFS version 3 protocol error values".
//!
//! The assertions are at the protocol level. `RpcClient::call` (shared with `test.rs`) already
//! asserts the whole RPC envelope — REPLY, MSG_ACCEPTED, accept_stat SUCCESS, an AUTH_NULL
//! verifier and the call's own xid echoed — which matters here more than anywhere else: a
//! reply the client discards as malformed is indistinguishable from the silence this test
//! exists to prevent.
