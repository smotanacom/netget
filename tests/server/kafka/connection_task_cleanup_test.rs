//! A Kafka connection that ends reaps its connection-scoped scheduled tasks.
//!
//! `TaskScope::Connection` says in its own doc comment that such a task is "automatically
//! cleaned up when connection closes", and the mechanism that does it is
//! `AppState::close_connection_on_server`, which marks the row `Closed` **and** calls
//! `cleanup_connection_tasks`. Kafka's teardown called `update_connection_status(…, Closed)`
//! instead: the same row, the same status, and none of the reaping. The tasks outlived the
//! socket, and a recurring one kept ticking — each tick an LLM prompt about a peer that had
//! hung up, charged to a `connection_id` nothing answers to any more. That is the defect
//! `remove_server` was restructured to prevent (`tests/mcp_stop_cleanup_test.rs`), one level
//! down: there it was a stopped server's tasks, here it is a closed connection's.
//!
//! **This test fails without the fix.** Put `update_connection_status` back and the task is
//! still in `get_connection_tasks` after the connection is gone.
//!
//! The control half matters as much as the assertion: the task is registered while the
//! connection is live and asserted present, so a test that reaped nothing because it never
//! registered anything cannot pass.
//!
//! Zero LLM calls: the peer connects and closes without sending a request, and the LLM
//! endpoint is a dead port so a stray call would fail loudly. Loopback only.
//!
//! Run with:
//!   ./cargo-isolated.sh test --no-default-features --features kafka --test server -- kafka::connection_task_cleanup --test-threads=100
