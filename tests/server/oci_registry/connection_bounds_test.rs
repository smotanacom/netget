//! OCI registry's connection bounds, driven from the wire.
//!
//! Before September 2026 this server accepted without limit and bounded no read in time, so a
//! peer that connected and said nothing held a socket, a connection task and an `AppState` entry
//! forever, pre-authentication, on a server that would happily accept 255 more. The pair of
//! bounds and the cap that close that are declared in `src/server/oci_registry/mod.rs`; this file is the
//! evidence they are wired rather than merely written down.
//!
//! Each check fails without the thing it tests — see `tests/helpers/http_bounds.rs`, which states
//! how, and holds the assertions shared by the eleven hyper servers in this family.
//!
//! The second check is the one specific to OCI registry: crane pulls a manifest and then each blob, writing layers to disk in between.
//!
//! Run with:
//!   ./cargo-isolated.sh test --no-default-features --features oci-registry --test server -- \
//!       oci_registry::connection_bounds --test-threads=100
