//! The read deadlines on a real, running SSH server, driven from the wire.
//!
//! Before September 2026 this server accepted without limit and bounded no read in time at the
//! point that mattered: a peer that connected and never sent its identification string held a
//! socket, a task and an `AppState` row for as long as it liked, before any authentication, on a
//! server that would happily accept a hundred more. russh's `inactivity_timeout` was set to an
//! hour as an unexplained literal, which is not a bound on *that* state in any useful sense.
//!
//! Two properties are asserted, and each one alone would be satisfied by a bug:
//!
//! 1. A peer that connects and **sends no identification string** is closed at
//!    `FIRST_BYTE_READ_TIMEOUT`. The server's own `SSH-2.0-…` line still goes out first — SSH is
//!    the one protocol in this sweep where the server legitimately speaks first, which is why the
//!    bound is on the stream rather than a `peek`.
//! 2. A peer that **has sent its identification string** is not closed at that bound. An
//!    interactive shell is legitimately silent for a long time, so the session bound is an hour;
//!    collapsing the two numbers would disconnect anyone who stopped typing for a minute.
//!
//! **How this was proved to fail without the bound**: hand `run_stream` the raw `TcpStream`
//! instead of the `DeadlinedStream` in `src/server/ssh/mod.rs` and the first test hangs for its
//! whole 100-second window, then fails with "still holding the socket".
//!
//! Run with:
//!   ./cargo-isolated.sh test --no-default-features --features ssh,tcp --test server -- ssh::connection_bounds --test-threads=100
