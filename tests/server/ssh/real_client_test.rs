//! The OpenSSH `ssh` binary — the **second** independent client for the SSH server.
//!
//! The rest of this directory drives `ssh2`, the Rust binding to the C **libssh2**. That is a
//! genuine third-party implementation — and it is the one whose absence, once, made this
//! protocol's rating wrong in both directions inside six weeks. But it is still **one**
//! implementation, and a rating resting on one client is a rating resting on that client's
//! leniency: `etcd` and `grpc` were each Beta on a single client while emitting no gRPC
//! trailers at all, and `mysql` was Beta on `mysql_async` while offering an auth plugin MySQL
//! 9.0 had deleted. In all three the *error* path was accidentally correct and the tests
//! asserted on the error path.
//!
//! OpenSSH is a third implementation again — neither russh (which this server is built on) nor
//! libssh2 — and it is the one an operator actually types.
//!
//! # What OpenSSH adds over libssh2
//!
//! - **It picks the algorithms.** OpenSSH 10 offers its own KEX and host-key preference list
//!   and will simply refuse a server whose offer it cannot meet. libssh2's list is different
//!   and older, so a russh configuration acceptable to libssh2 and unacceptable to OpenSSH
//!   would look fine here until this test existed.
//! - **`exec` without a PTY.** `ssh host <command>` opens an exec channel with no terminal
//!   attached, so the bytes the server writes reach stdout **unmodified** — no line discipline
//!   in between. That is how the CRLF finding below became visible at all.
//! - **It enforces the channel state machine.** A `SSH_MSG_CHANNEL_CLOSE` for a channel it has
//!   already freed is a fatal protocol error to OpenSSH and a no-op to libssh2. See part 1
//!   below.
//! - **The exit status is the answer.** `$(ssh host cmd)` captures stdout and a script branches
//!   on `$?`. OpenSSH surfaces the SSH `exit-status` request as its own exit code, so the
//!   status the server requested is asserted rather than inferred.
//! - **A refusal it renders itself.** A denied authentication comes back as OpenSSH's own
//!   `Permission denied (publickey).` and exit 255.
//!
//! # What this client found, part 1: a double `SSH_MSG_CHANNEL_CLOSE` — **fixed**
//!
//! `ssh host <command>` failed with exit **255** about one run in five, *after* the command's
//! output and `exit-status 0` had already arrived intact. OpenSSH at `LogLevel=DEBUG2` says
//! exactly what happened:
//!
//! ```text
//! debug2: channel 0: rcvd eof
//! debug2: channel 0: rcvd close
//! debug2: channel 0: send close for remote id 2
//! debug1: channel 0: free: client-session, nchannels 1
//! channel_by_id: 0: bad id: channel free
//! Disconnecting 127.0.0.1 port N: oclose packet referred to nonexistent channel 0
//! ```
//!
//! RFC 4254 §5.3 lets each party send `SSH_MSG_CHANNEL_CLOSE` once. NetGet sent two:
//! `exec_request` sends exit-status + EOF + CLOSE as soon as the answer is ready, and then the
//! client's *own* EOF arrives and `channel_eof` sent a second CLOSE. The race is whether the
//! client has garbage-collected the channel by then — if not, it is a
//! `channel 0: protocol error: close rcvd twice` on stderr and the session survives; if it
//! has, the CLOSE names a channel that no longer exists and OpenSSH disconnects.
//!
//! libssh2 ignores the second CLOSE, so nothing in the rest of this directory could see it.
//! `SshHandler::close_channel_once` is the fix, and the `stderr` assertion below is the guard.
//! Measured: **4 failures in 20 runs before, 0 in 25 after.**
//!
//! # What this client found, part 2: CRLF on the exec path — **not fixed**
//!
//! **NetGet translates `\n` to `\r\n` on the exec path, and a real `sshd` does not.**
//! `SshServerHandler::normalize_line_endings` is applied to every shell response
//! (`src/server/ssh/mod.rs`), including the one-shot `exec_request` path, where no PTY exists.
//! Real `sshd` never translates: the CRLF an interactive session shows comes from the *pty's*
//! `ONLCR`, not from the server. So
//!
//! ```text
//! ssh netget@host 'cat /etc/hostname' | xxd
//! ```
//!
//! returns `…\r\n` here and `…\n` against OpenSSH sshd, and the common `OUT=$(ssh host cmd)`
//! leaves a stray `\r` at the end of `$OUT`. Nothing in `ssh2`'s tests could see this: they
//! compare the output against a string the same test wrote, so `\r\n` on both sides agrees
//! with itself.
//!
//! This is **asserted as it behaves**, not as it ought to: the assertion below names the CRLF
//! explicitly and says why, so that a fix changes a test that describes the defect rather than
//! silently satisfying one that never noticed. The server is not changed here — `pty_request`
//! is not handled at all in `mod.rs`, so the honest fix (translate only when a PTY was
//! requested on that channel) is a change to the channel bookkeeping, not a one-line edit, and
//! it belongs with whoever owns that.
//!
//! # Non-vacuity: what was broken, and what OpenSSH then printed
//!
//! Verified by breaking the server and re-running the same commands.
//!
//! 1. **The auth decision inverted** — `SshServerHandler::llm_auth_decision`'s `Ok(true)`
//!    branch made to return `Ok(false)`, so the model's `allowed: true` no longer admitted
//!    anyone. OpenSSH printed `netget@127.0.0.1: Permission denied (publickey).` and exited
//!    **255**, and the test failed on the session it expected to succeed.
//! 2. **The exec exit status** made `69` unconditionally in `exec_request`. The command output
//!    still arrived intact on stdout, so every byte-level assertion still passed; only the exit
//!    code changed, and OpenSSH reported **69**. A test that read stdout and ignored `$?` would
//!    have passed against it — which is the whole point of asserting on the status.
//!
//! Both were reverted. (The one change to `src/server/ssh/` that stands is
//! `close_channel_once`, which is the fix for part 1 above, not a break.)
//!
//! Run with:
//!   ./cargo-isolated.sh test --no-default-features --features ssh \
//!       --test server -- server::ssh::real_client --test-threads=8
