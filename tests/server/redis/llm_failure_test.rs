//! What a Redis client gets when the LLM backend fails: a RESP error, decoded by `redis-rs`.
//!
//! Redis already answered `-ERR` here, so this test is mostly a regression guard - but it also
//! covers a real defect that was fixed alongside it. The message used to be
//! `format!("ERR LLM error: {}", e)` with the error text interpolated raw, and a RESP simple
//! error is CRLF-terminated with no length prefix: a newline anywhere in the text ends the
//! frame early and everything after it is parsed as the *next* reply. Backend error strings
//! are routinely multi-line, so that would have desynchronised the connection permanently.
//!
//! The assertion below reads the reply back through `redis-rs`, an independent implementation
//! of RESP, which is what makes "the client saw an error and not a value" evidence rather than
//! a restatement of our own encoder.
