//! The read deadlines on a real, running Redis server, driven from a raw socket.
//!
//! Three claims, and the first two pull in opposite directions.
//!
//! **A peer that has connected and said nothing must eventually be let go of.** Nothing else in
//! the process will close that socket: it holds a task, an `AppState` row and one of
//! `MAX_CONNECTIONS` slots, pre-authentication, so the server has to give up first. Remove the
//! deadline around the read in `src/server/redis/mod.rs` and the first test hangs until its own
//! window expires.
//!
//! **But the default must not be short enough to drop the operator's own peer.** NetGet's Redis
//! client is a bare `TcpStream::connect` that sends nothing until an action says to, and a
//! client created from the dashboard's `[ + redis client ]` is routed `*` -> manual: it connects
//! and waits for a person to type into `[ send message ]`. At the 30 seconds this bound used to
//! carry, the server dropped that peer while the operator was still looking at it — the same
//! defect `src/server/tcp/mod.rs` had. The third test is the regression for it and is
//! deliberately slow: proving a peer survives *past* the old bound means waiting past it.
//!
//! **And the two bounds are different claims**, so the second test drives a command through and
//! then goes quiet, which must be governed by `idle_timeout_secs` rather than by the first-byte
//! one. Its command is answered by a static routing rule, so no model is involved.
//!
//! The values here are overrides, not the defaults. `FIRST_COMMAND_READ_TIMEOUT` is 300
//! seconds — the window a `manual` rule gives a human (`src/state/intercepts.rs`) — and a test
//! that asserted it by waiting it out would be the slowest thing in the suite. That is why both
//! bounds are declared startup parameters: what is asserted here is that each parameter is read
//! and applied to the read it names; the *values* are argued where they are declared.
//!
//! No mock backend: the LLM endpoint is a dead port. These tests assert on deadlines, not on
//! answers. Loopback only.
//!
//! Run with:
//!   ./cargo-isolated.sh test --no-default-features --features redis --test server -- \
//!       redis::connection_bounds --test-threads=100
