//! Two things a Redis server must not let model output do: end a RESP frame early, and
//! outlive `stop_server`.
//!
//! Zero LLM calls throughout — a `*` static handler supplies the reply, and
//! `instruction: Some(String::new())` keeps `ServerForm::create` from substituting its default
//! instruction (any non-empty instruction makes `operator_wants_dynamic` true, so a server
//! built with `..Default::default()` consults the model whatever a comment claims).
//!
//! Run with:
//!   ./cargo-isolated.sh test --no-default-features --features redis --test server -- redis::resp_framing --test-threads=100
