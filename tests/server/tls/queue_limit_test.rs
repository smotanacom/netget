//! Application data queued while an answer is in flight is bounded, and the peer is told.
//!
//! # What was wrong
//!
//! `ConnectionData::queued_data` is the `Accumulating` half of the Idle → Processing →
//! Accumulating machine: a peer may keep writing while the model is being asked what to say,
//! and those bytes are held until the answer arrives. It had **no ceiling at all**, so the peer
//! decided how much memory one connection cost — and it decided it during a window it also
//! controls the length of. An LLM round-trip is seconds; a `manual` rule parks the record for a
//! **human** and defaults to 300 seconds (`src/state/intercepts.rs`). Times 256 connections.
//!
//! Nothing stands in front of it: TLS here requires no authentication, and the first record a
//! stranger sends opens the window.
//!
//! # What this asserts, and what "refused" means on a TLS wire
//!
//! The refusal is a **close_notify alert, and that is not the alert this deserves**. TLS has a
//! description for exactly this — `record_overflow(22)` — and rustls 0.23 will not send it:
//! `CommonState::send_fatal_alert` is `pub(crate)`, and the only alert its public API emits is
//! `send_close_notify`. Writing the raw seven bytes of a `record_overflow` alert onto the TCP
//! socket underneath is not an alternative either: after the handshake every record is
//! encrypted, so a plaintext one is a protocol violation the peer must reject — it would arrive
//! as garbage rather than as a reason. Asserting `read() -> Ok(0)` is therefore the strongest
//! available evidence, and it is real evidence: an abrupt close with no alert surfaces as
//! `UnexpectedEof`, not `Ok(0)`, which is the same distinction
//! `tests/server/tls/llm_failure_test.rs` rests on. The rest of the refusal is in the log,
//! which is where the project CLAUDE.md says a distinction the wire cannot carry belongs.
//!
//! The second test is what stops the first from being satisfiable by a server that hangs up on
//! everybody: the same exchange, well under the cap, must **not** be closed.
