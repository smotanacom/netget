//! The read deadlines on a real, running TLS server, driven from a raw socket and from a real
//! rustls client.
//!
//! **Four claims, and the first is that there are three bounds here rather than two.** One
//! constant used to govern both the wait for the handshake and the wait for the first
//! application record, on the reasoning that from the peer's side they are one condition: it
//! holds a socket and has produced nothing usable. They are not one condition, because they face
//! different peers. The handshake bound faces something that has opened a TCP socket and not yet
//! sent a ClientHello. The first-record bound faces something that has *completed* a handshake —
//! which, here, is usually NetGet's own TLS client: `src/client/tls/mod.rs` runs
//! `TlsConnector::connect` inside its own `connect()` and then writes **no application bytes at
//! all** unprompted, and a client created from the dashboard's `[ + tls client ]` is routed
//! `tls_client_connected` → static-with-no-actions and then `*` → manual
//! (`src/tui/modal/form.rs`). At the 60 seconds both bounds used to share, this server hung up
//! on the operator's own client while they were still looking at it — and, unlike in the
//! handshake phase, there was nothing the peer could have done about it.
//!
//! So: a TCP peer that never sends a ClientHello is closed on `handshake_timeout_secs` (first
//! test); a peer that completes the handshake and then says nothing is closed on
//! `first_byte_timeout_secs` (second test); and a peer that has *sent* application data and then
//! goes quiet is closed on `idle_timeout_secs` (third test). Remove any one of those deadlines
//! and its test hangs until its own window expires, because nothing else in the process will
//! close that socket.
//!
//! **The fourth test is the regression**, and it is deliberately the slow one: proving that the
//! first-record default outlasts the 60 seconds it used to be means waiting past 60 seconds.
//!
//! The values the first three tests use are *overrides*, not the defaults. That is why all three
//! bounds are declared startup parameters: what is asserted here is that each parameter is read
//! and applied to the read it names; the *values* are argued where they are declared, in
//! `src/server/tls/mod.rs`.
//!
//! No mock backend: the LLM endpoint is a dead port. These tests assert on deadlines, not on
//! answers. Loopback only.
//!
//! Run with:
//!   ./cargo-isolated.sh test --no-default-features --features tls --test server -- \
//!       tls::connection_bounds --test-threads=100
