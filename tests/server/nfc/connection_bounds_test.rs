//! The read deadlines on a real, running NFC virtual tag, driven from a raw socket.
//!
//! The peer here is a vpcd reader: `u16` big-endian length, then a payload that is either a
//! one-byte control code or a command APDU. Both tests speak that framing directly, which is
//! all a reader ever does.
//!
//! **A reader that has connected and sent no frame must eventually be let go of.** Nothing else
//! in the process closes that socket: it holds a task, an `AppState` row and one of
//! `MAX_CONNECTIONS` slots, and this server registers no peer channel, so there is not even an
//! operator who could be driving it. Remove the deadline around `read_half.read_u16()` in
//! `src/server/nfc/mod.rs` and the first test hangs until its own window expires.
//!
//! **Once a frame has been answered the *idle* bound governs, not the first-byte one.** The
//! second test sends the vpcd `ATR` control code, which the tag answers from its own state with
//! no model involved at all, and then goes quiet — with the two bounds set far apart and the
//! wrong way round, so a read loop that never switched would hold the connection for 60 seconds
//! and time the assertion out.
//!
//! The values here are overrides, not the defaults. The shipped defaults are 30 seconds and 300
//! (argued beside `FIRST_FRAME_READ_TIMEOUT` and `IDLE_BETWEEN_FRAMES_TIMEOUT`), and a test
//! that asserted them by waiting them out would be the slowest thing in the suite. That is why
//! both are declared startup parameters: what is asserted here is that each parameter is read
//! and applied to the read it names; the *values* are argued where they are declared.
//!
//! No mock backend: the LLM endpoint is a dead port, and the tag's startup configuration call
//! is explicitly non-fatal when it fails. Loopback only.
//!
//! Run with:
//!   ./cargo-isolated.sh test --no-default-features --features nfc --test server -- \
//!       nfc::connection_bounds --test-threads=100
