//! The connection cap on a real, running BGP speaker, driven from the wire.
//!
//! `OPEN_HOLD_TIME` is four minutes — RFC 4271 §8.2.2's own recommendation for the window
//! before an OPEN has been exchanged — so one silent stranger legitimately holds a socket, a
//! session task, a writer task and an `AppState` row for 240 seconds. Nothing bounded how many
//! such strangers there could be at once, and four minutes multiplied by an unbounded arrival
//! rate is not a bound.
//!
//! Three claims:
//!
//! 1. `MAX_CONNECTIONS` peers are admitted.
//! 2. The next one is refused with NOTIFICATION 6/8 — Cease / Out of Resources — and then
//!    closed. The expected message is rebuilt here from RFC 4271 §4.5's framing rather than
//!    imported from `wire.rs`, so this asserts against the RFC and not against the encoder
//!    that produced it.
//! 3. Closing an admitted session **frees exactly one slot**. A permit dropped before the
//!    session ends un-caps the speaker silently; one never released wedges it shut after
//!    `MAX_CONNECTIONS` peers have ever connected.
//!
//! **BGP is the rare protocol in this sweep whose refusal needs nothing from the peer**, which
//! is why it gets a real message where `mongodb`, `doh` and `dot` get a plain close. A
//! NOTIFICATION is self-contained — marker, length, type, code, subcode — with no field
//! echoing anything the sender has received, and RFC 4271 §6 allows one in any state including
//! Connect and Active. The subcode is 8 rather than 5 because a full connection table is a
//! transient resource condition that RFC 4486 §8 has the peer damp and retry, where §4's
//! `Connection Rejected` means a permanent policy refusal.
//!
//! **How this was proved to fail without the cap**: replace the `accept_bounded` call in
//! `src/server/bgp/mod.rs` with a bare `listener.accept().await` (and drop the permit from the
//! session task). The over-cap peer is then admitted and sits in OpenSent waiting for an OPEN
//! for four minutes, and the test fails on the read timing out.
//!
//! The server is model-free: an empty instruction really is model-free, where `None` is
//! replaced by a default one. BGP waits for the peer's OPEN, so a peer that says nothing
//! provokes no model call. Loopback only.
//!
//! Run with:
//!   ./cargo-isolated.sh test --no-default-features --features bgp --test server -- bgp::connection_bounds --test-threads=100
