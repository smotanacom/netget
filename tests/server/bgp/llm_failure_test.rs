//! Regression test: when the operator has configured a dynamic peering policy and the backend
//! cannot be reached, BGP fails **closed** with a NOTIFICATION rather than admitting the peer.
//!
//! Two failure modes are being guarded against at once, and they are opposites:
//!
//! 1. **Fail open.** `bgp_open` used to collapse "the model answered nothing" and "the LLM call
//!    errored" into one `SendOutcome::Nothing`, which sends the *configured* OPEN and proceeds
//!    to OpenConfirm. With an admission policy in the instruction ("peer only with AS
//!    65000-65535"), a backend outage therefore admitted every neighbour the policy would have
//!    refused — the fail-open pattern the root CLAUDE.md calls the most dangerous in this
//!    codebase. Silence from a model that *was* consulted still takes the configured-OPEN path;
//!    only a failure to consult it at all refuses.
//!
//! 2. **Leaking the error.** A BGP NOTIFICATION has no free-text field at all, so the only thing
//!    the peer can be told is a `(code, subcode)` pair. The category is carried there and
//!    nowhere else; the error itself goes to the log and the status stream.
//!
//! The mock deliberately has **no rule for `bgp_open`**, so that request goes unmatched and the
//! harness answers HTTP 500 — a real backend failure as far as NetGet is concerned. The
//! unmatched request is recorded as a harness diagnostic, which is informational and does not
//! fail `verify_mocks()`.
