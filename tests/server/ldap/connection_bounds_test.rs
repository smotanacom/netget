//! The read deadlines and the connection cap on a real, running LDAP server, from the wire.
//!
//! Before September 2026 this server accepted without limit and bounded no read in time: a peer
//! that connected and said nothing held a socket, a connection task and an `AppState` entry
//! forever, pre-authentication — which for LDAP means before any bind at all — on a server that
//! would happily accept a hundred more.
//!
//! Three properties are asserted, and each one alone would be satisfied by a bug:
//!
//! 1. A peer that connects and **says nothing** is closed at the first-message bound (set here
//!    through the `first_byte_timeout_secs` startup parameter, so the test does not have to
//!    wait out the 300-second default).
//! 2. A peer that **binds** is answered and survives well past that same bound: the deadline is
//!    on the silence, not on the connection. A pooling LDAP client holds a bound connection open
//!    between operations, so a single number applied to both would break it.
//! 3. The connection past `MAX_CONNECTIONS` is refused **in LDAP's own vocabulary** — an
//!    unsolicited Notice of Disconnection (RFC 4511 §4.4.1) carrying `unavailable (52)` — and
//!    releasing one admitted connection frees exactly one slot.
//!
//! **How this was proved to fail without the bound**: replace the `tokio::time::timeout(...)`
//! around `self.stream.read(...)` in `src/server/ldap/mod.rs` with a bare read and the first
//! test hangs for its whole assertion window, then fails with "still holding the socket".
//!
//! Run with:
//!   ./cargo-isolated.sh test --no-default-features --features ldap,tcp --test server -- ldap::connection_bounds --test-threads=100
