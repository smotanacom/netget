//! A model-supplied `result_code` narrowed with `as u8` encoded LDAP *success*.
//!
//! The wrap lands on the worst possible value here. `256 as u8` is `0`, and resultCode `0` is
//! `success` — so every refusal the model can express sits a multiple of 256 away from a
//! directory telling the client the bind, the write or the search completed. Fail-open by
//! arithmetic, and silent: the encoder produced a perfectly well-formed success.
//!
//! `message_id` had the same shape through `as i32`. A client matches replies by messageID
//! alone, so `4294967297` becoming `1` answers whichever request happened to hold that id.
//!
//! # Why this compares encodings rather than decoding BER
//!
//! The responses are hand-rolled BER, so a test that re-implemented the decoder would agree
//! with the encoder about being wrong together. Asserting that the out-of-range value is
//! *refused*, and that it would otherwise have been byte-identical to the success encoding,
//! needs no decoder and holds however resultCode is framed. `fail_open_action_defaults_test`
//! makes the same argument for the sibling defect in these actions.
