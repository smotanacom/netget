//! The connection bounds on a real, running POP3 server, driven from the wire.
//!
//! Two claims, and they pull in opposite directions — which is the point. A peer that has
//! connected and said nothing must be let go of; a connection that is in the middle of being
//! answered must not be.
//!
//! **The first test fails without the bound.** Remove the deadline around the read in
//! `src/server/pop3/mod.rs` and it hangs until its own assertion window expires, because
//! nothing else in the process will ever close that socket: the peer is holding a task, an
//! `AppState` row and a connection slot, pre-authentication, and it is the server that has to
//! give up first.
//!
//! **The second test is what stops a lazy fix.** A deadline that wrapped the answer as well as
//! the read would satisfy the first test and break the protocol, because an LLM round-trip takes
//! seconds and a `manual` rule parks the event for a *human* — 300 seconds by default
//! (`src/state/intercepts.rs`). Here every event is routed to `manual`, so the answer is
//! outstanding for the whole of the wait, and the connection has to survive it.
//!
//! POP3's idle bound is RFC 1939 §3's ten-minute autologout minimum; the shorter first-command
//! bound ahead of it is Dovecot's `login_timeout`, and the two do not contradict because what
//! the RFC protects is a session, which a peer that has issued no command does not have.
//!
//! No mock backend: the LLM endpoint is a dead port. These tests assert on *deadlines*, not on
//! answers. Loopback only.
//!
//! Run with:
//!   ./cargo-isolated.sh test --no-default-features --features pop3 --test server -- pop3::connection_bounds --test-threads=100
