//! The connection bounds on a real, running VNC server, driven from the wire.
//!
//! Two claims, and they pull in opposite directions — which is the point. A peer that has
//! connected and said nothing must be let go of; a connection that is in the middle of being
//! answered must not be.
//!
//! **The first test fails without the bound.** VNC reads in several scattered steps — the
//! version exchange, the security choice, `ClientInit`, each message-type octet and each message
//! body — so `src/server/vnc/mod.rs` wraps its read half in an `IdleTimeoutReader` rather than
//! timing out one call. Take that wrapper off and the first test hangs until its own assertion
//! window expires: the server has written `RFB 003.008\n` and is parked in `read_exact` waiting
//! for twelve bytes that will never come, holding a task, an `AppState` row and a connection
//! slot. Nothing else in the process will close that socket.
//!
//! **The second test is what stops a lazy fix.** `IdleTimeoutReader`'s deadline is armed lazily,
//! only while a read is actually pending, so an LLM round-trip — or a `manual` rule parking an
//! event for a *human*, 300 seconds by default (`src/state/intercepts.rs`) — runs with no clock
//! against it. Arm it eagerly instead and a viewer whose `FramebufferUpdateRequest` is waiting on
//! a person is hung up on mid-answer.
//!
//! This test completes the whole RFB 3.8 handshake by hand, because that is the only way to
//! reach an event: version, security type `None`, `SecurityResult`, `ClientInit`, `ServerInit`,
//! and then one `FramebufferUpdateRequest`.
//!
//! No mock backend: the LLM endpoint is a dead port. These tests assert on *deadlines*, not on
//! answers. Loopback only.
//!
//! Run with:
//!   ./cargo-isolated.sh test --no-default-features --features vnc --test server -- vnc::connection_bounds --test-threads=100
