//! NATS' inbound bound, driven from the wire: the per-instance `max_payload` and the
//! `MAX_PAYLOAD_CEILING` that no configuration can exceed.
//!
//! NATS has one peer-chosen length that is buffered: the `<#bytes>` a `PUB` (or the total an
//! `HPUB`) declares. It is checked against `max_payload` on the **declared** number, before any
//! payload is read, and `max_payload` itself is capped at `MAX_PAYLOAD_CEILING` — the declared
//! `max_inbound_bytes`. So there are two numbers and each is tested:
//!
//! 1. At the default `max_payload` (1 MiB), a `PUB` of exactly 1 MiB reaches the model; one of
//!    1 MiB + 1 is answered `-ERR 'Maximum Payload Violation'` and closed with zero model calls;
//!    and a fresh connection is still served.
//! 2. `max_payload` above `MAX_PAYLOAD_CEILING` refuses to start, and at exactly the ceiling a
//!    `PUB` declaring ceiling + 1 is refused on its control line alone — no 64 MiB is sent,
//!    because the check is on the declared size, which is the property being tested.
//!
//! **Verified by removal.** With the `total_len > max_payload` check in `parse_one_frame`
//! removed, test 1's over-bound `PUB` is buffered and handed to the model (the refusal
//! assertion fails); with the startup ceiling removed, test 2's server starts.
//!
//! Run with:
//!   ./cargo-isolated.sh test --no-default-features --features nats --test server -- nats::inbound_limit --test-threads=100
