//! The read deadlines and the connection cap on a real, running NATS server, from the wire.
//!
//! Before September 2026 this server accepted without limit and bounded no read in time: a peer
//! that took the `INFO` greeting and said nothing held a socket, **two** tasks, a 256-frame
//! queue and an `AppState` entry forever, before `CONNECT`, on a server that would happily
//! accept a hundred more.
//!
//! Three properties are asserted, and each one alone would be satisfied by a bug:
//!
//! 1. A greeted peer that **says nothing** is closed at `FIRST_FRAME_READ_TIMEOUT`, and told
//!    `-ERR 'Stale Connection'` rather than dropped silently.
//! 2. A peer that **has spoken** survives well past that same bound. The longer bound
//!    (`IDLE_BETWEEN_FRAMES_TIMEOUT`, 600s) is what lets a subscriber sit there: it must be
//!    above the interval at which NATS clients PING — 60s for `async-nats`, 2 minutes for
//!    `nats-server` itself — and collapsing the two numbers into one would drop every
//!    subscription.
//! 3. The connection past `MAX_CONNECTIONS` is refused in NATS's own vocabulary, with the exact
//!    `-ERR 'Maximum Connections Exceeded'` line `nats-server` sends, and releasing one admitted
//!    connection frees exactly one slot.
//!
//! **How this was proved to fail without the bound**: delete the `tokio::time::sleep(...)` arm
//! from the reader's `select!` in `src/server/nats/mod.rs` and the first test hangs for its
//! whole 70-second window, then fails with "still holding the socket".
//!
//! Run with:
//!   ./cargo-isolated.sh test --no-default-features --features nats,tcp --test server -- nats::connection_bounds --test-threads=100
