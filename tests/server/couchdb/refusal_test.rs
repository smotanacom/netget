//! Two things the CouchDB server must refuse rather than wave through.
//!
//! **An oversized request body.** `Incoming` has no default limit, so the handler buffered
//! whatever an unauthenticated peer chose to send — one `POST /db/_bulk_docs` was enough to
//! exhaust the process — and the body is then embedded whole in an LLM prompt, so there is no
//! legitimate large one either. The refusal has to land *before* the LLM call, which is why
//! this test counts model calls as well as checking the status.
//!
//! **A replication response nothing asserted.** `send_replication_response` declared every
//! parameter optional and defaulted every one, so a bare `{"type":
//! "send_replication_response"}` produced `{"ok": true}` — the most affirmative body the
//! replication protocol has — complete with the literal session id `"abc123"` and
//! `source_last_seq: "0"`. That is the OAuth2 fail-open shape: a model that meant to say
//! nothing said yes, and a peer stored a checkpoint for a replication that never ran.
