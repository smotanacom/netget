//! The connection bounds on a real, running TCP server, driven from the wire.
//!
//! Two claims, and they pull in opposite directions — which is the point. A peer that has
//! connected and said nothing must be let go of; a connection that is in the middle of being
//! answered must not be.
//!
//! **The first test fails without the bound.** Remove the deadline around the read in
//! `src/server/tcp/mod.rs` and it hangs until its own assertion window expires, because
//! nothing else in the process will ever close that socket: the peer is holding a task, an
//! `AppState` row and a connection slot, pre-authentication, and it is the server that has to
//! give up first.
//!
//! **The second test is what stops a lazy fix.** A deadline that wrapped the answer as well as
//! the read would satisfy the first test and break the protocol, because an LLM round-trip takes
//! seconds and a `manual` rule parks the event for a *human* — 300 seconds by default
//! (`src/state/intercepts.rs`). Here every event is routed to `manual`, so the answer is
//! outstanding for the whole of the wait, and the connection has to survive it.
//!
//! **TCP is the one of the ten whose read loop does not stop while a request is answered.**
//! Every other server here awaits the model inline, so its `read()` is not even being polled
//! during the answer and no clock can run against it. This one hands each message to a spawned
//! task and goes straight back to `read()`, so the deadline and the answer are live at the same
//! moment — which is exactly why it consults `ConnectionActivity`, and why the second test below
//! drives a `send_first` banner that is parked for a human while the peer says nothing. Remove
//! the `activity.busy()` guard from the banner task and the connection is closed at 30 seconds
//! while the human is still composing the greeting it was opened for.
//!
//! No mock backend: the LLM endpoint is a dead port. These tests assert on *deadlines*, not on
//! answers. Loopback only.
//!
//! Run with:
//!   ./cargo-isolated.sh test --no-default-features --features tcp --test server -- tcp::connection_bounds --test-threads=100
