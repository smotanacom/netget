//! The read deadlines on a real, running Memcached server, driven from the wire.
//!
//! Memcached is the shortest of the eighteen — `FIRST_COMMAND_READ_TIMEOUT` is 30s and
//! `IDLE_BETWEEN_COMMANDS_TIMEOUT` is 120s — which makes it the one protocol whose *pair* can
//! be demonstrated end to end in a test that finishes: the first bound fires, and the second
//! demonstrably has not fired at the same moment. Remove the `tokio::time::timeout` around the
//! read in `src/server/memcached/mod.rs` and the first test below hangs until its own 60s
//! assertion window expires; shorten the pair to one number and the second fails.
//!
//! The shared mechanism (the cap, `IdleTimeoutReader`, `ConnectionActivity`) is covered by
//! `tests/accept_bounded_test.rs`, and that every one of the eighteen is wired to both by
//! `tests/tcp_server_bounds_ratchet_test.rs`. This file is the evidence that the wiring does
//! what it says against a socket.
//!
//! No mock backend: the LLM endpoint is a dead port, so any command is answered
//! `SERVER_ERROR` on memcached's fail-closed path. That is deliberate — these tests assert on
//! *deadlines*, not on answers, and a fail-closed reply proves the connection is alive exactly
//! as well as a cache hit would. The first test sends no command at all.
//!
//! Run with:
//!   ./cargo-isolated.sh test --no-default-features --features memcached --test server -- memcached::connection_bounds --test-threads=100
