//! What a memcached client gets when the LLM backend fails: `SERVER_ERROR`.
//!
//! `SERVER_ERROR <text>` is protocol.txt's own form for "the command was valid and the server
//! failed to run it". No client treats it as data, so it cannot be read as a cache hit, a
//! stored value or a successful delete - which matters more here than in most protocols,
//! because `END` (a miss) is a perfectly ordinary answer that a broken server could otherwise
//! produce by accident.
//!
//! The reason text is stripped of CR/LF: memcached replies are CRLF-terminated with no length
//! prefix, so a newline inside the text ends the reply early and the remainder is parsed as
//! the next one.
