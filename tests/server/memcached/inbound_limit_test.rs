//! Memcached's declared `max_inbound_bytes` — `protocol::MAX_VALUE_LEN` — driven from the wire.
//!
//! The text protocol has exactly one length a peer chooses: the `<bytes>` a storage command
//! declares for its data block. Everything else is one CRLF-terminated line under
//! `MAX_COMMAND_LINE`. So the bound is tested the way a real client meets it — a `set` that
//! declares `MAX_VALUE_LEN` and one that declares `MAX_VALUE_LEN + 1`, each followed by its full
//! data block, exactly as libmemcached writes them — and three things are asserted:
//!
//! 1. **`bound` is accepted**: the `set` at exactly the cap reaches the model. Without this the
//!    refusal below could be a server that refuses every large value.
//! 2. **`bound + 1` is refused before the model**: the peer reads upstream memcached's own
//!    `SERVER_ERROR object too large for cache`, then EOF, and the model is called zero times.
//! 3. **The server still serves**: a fresh connection's command reaches the model.
//!
//! **Verified by removal.** With the `bytes > MAX_VALUE_LEN` check in `parse_storage` removed,
//! assertion 2 fails: the over-cap `set` is buffered whole and handed to the model, which the
//! call count records.
//!
//! Run with:
//!   ./cargo-isolated.sh test --no-default-features --features memcached --test server -- memcached::inbound_limit --test-threads=100
