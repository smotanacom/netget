//! Telnet's three quiet endings, told apart in the log.
//!
//! `llm_failure_test.rs` beside this one covers the loud ending: when the backend fails the
//! peer gets a `[netget] …` notice (a category, never the error) and the log carries
//! `decision=fail_closed_llm_*`.
//!
//! The other three write **nothing** to the socket, which is where the ambiguity lives:
//!
//! | the model… | what the peer sees |
//! |---|---|
//! | answered `close_connection` | the session ends, with no reply |
//! | answered `wait_for_more` | nothing; the session stays open |
//! | answered with no action at all | nothing; the session stays open |
//!
//! The last two are indistinguishable from the peer's seat — a human sitting at a terminal
//! that looks hung — and were indistinguishable in the log too, because neither wrote a line.
//! `decision=model_reject`, `decision=model_wait_for_more` and `decision=model_silent` are
//! what separate them now.
