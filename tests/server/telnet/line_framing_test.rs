//! How the Telnet server frames what arrives on the wire.
//!
//! Both tests cover a defect that was reachable by any peer, with no authentication in front
//! of it, and both run on a **script** handler so nothing here depends on a model.
//!
//! 1. A real `telnet(1)` client opens by sending `IAC DO/WILL …` negotiation. Those bytes are
//!    not valid UTF-8, and the server used to read lines with `BufReader::read_line`, which
//!    validates UTF-8 over the whole line and returns `InvalidData` when it fails — so the
//!    first line the user typed arrived behind that junk, failed to decode, and the read loop
//!    closed the connection. `actions.rs` told the model those bytes "arrive as part of the
//!    first message"; they never did.
//! 2. `read_line` grows its `String` until a newline arrives, so a peer streaming bytes with
//!    no `\n` among them made the server buffer every one of them.
