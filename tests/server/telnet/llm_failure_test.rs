//! What a Telnet client gets when the LLM backend fails: a plain notice on its own line.
//!
//! Telnet is where "send a protocol-appropriate error" has the least to work with. There is no
//! status code, no framing and no transaction id - it is an unstructured byte stream with a
//! human on the other end. So the protocol-appropriate answer is literally a sentence, written
//! on its own CRLF-delimited line so it cannot be mistaken for the output of whatever the user
//! typed, and prefixed `[netget]` so it is clearly the server speaking rather than the
//! simulated system.
//!
//! Silence would be the wrong call here even though the protocol has no error frame, because
//! unlike bare UDP there is a connection and a human waiting on it: a Telnet session that
//! stops answering is indistinguishable from one that has hung.
