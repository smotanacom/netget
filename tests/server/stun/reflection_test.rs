//! Regression test: the STUN server answers a Binding **Request** and nothing else.
//!
//! Every reply this server sends goes to the source address written in a UDP datagram, which
//! anyone can forge. So the set of messages it is willing to answer is its whole reflection
//! surface, and that set must be exactly "Binding Request".
//!
//! Before this, `parse_stun_header` returned `is_valid` for any datagram carrying the magic
//! cookie — a Binding *Response* included. Two consequences, both reachable by a stranger with
//! one packet:
//!
//! * **A loop.** One spoofed datagram whose source is a second NetGet STUN server sets the two
//!   answering each other's answers, forever; nothing in either side breaks the cycle.
//! * **Amplification.** A 20-byte request draws a 48-byte reply (XOR-MAPPED-ADDRESS plus
//!   SOFTWARE), so a spoofed source makes this a ~2.4x amplifier aimed at whoever the attacker
//!   names.
//!
//! The control case is what gives the silences meaning: a real Binding Request on the same
//! socket must still be answered. Without it "nothing came back" is indistinguishable from a
//! server that was never reachable.
