//! STUN against a real, independent third-party client: **stuntman's `stunclient`**.
//!
//! # Why this test exists
//!
//! Every other test in `tests/server/stun/` builds its Binding Request by hand and decodes the
//! reply by hand. That is an independent *reading* of RFC 8489, not an independent
//! *implementation* of it — the same class of evidence `dhcp`'s in-test decoder provides, and
//! the reason `dhcp` is not Beta. A hand-rolled decoder that shares a misreading with the
//! server it checks agrees with it perfectly.
//!
//! `stunclient` is the command-line client from **stuntman** (1.2.16), a C++ STUN
//! implementation written by somebody who has never seen this repository. It builds its own
//! Binding Request with its own transaction ID, and — the part that matters — it must
//! **un-XOR** our XOR-MAPPED-ADDRESS attribute against the magic cookie and its own transaction
//! ID to recover the address it prints. If our attribute is encoded wrongly in any byte, the
//! address it prints is not the one it sent from, and the assertion below fails.
//!
//! # Not circular
//!
//! NetGet's STUN **server** is a hand-written RFC 8489 codec (`src/server/stun/`) with no STUN
//! library behind it. The `stunclient` *crate* that appears in `Cargo.toml` is a Rust library
//! used by NetGet's STUN **client** (`src/client/stun/`), which is a different program and is
//! not running here. The peer in this test is an unrelated C++ binary on `PATH`. Nothing on
//! either side of this exchange shares code with the other.
//!
//! # Zero LLM calls, deliberately
//!
//! The server is opened with an empty instruction, so the Binding response is produced
//! mechanically (see `static_default_test.rs`). That makes this test evidence about the
//! *protocol implementation* rather than about a mock's ability to echo a transaction ID: the
//! bytes stuntman accepts were assembled by `src/server/stun/`, and by nothing else.
