//! MQTT broker driven by the real **mosquitto** command-line clients.
//!
//! The peer here is deliberately not a Rust crate. `src/server/mqtt/mod.rs` is a
//! hand-written MQTT 3.1.1 control-packet codec, and `mosquitto_pub` /
//! `mosquitto_sub` are Eclipse Mosquitto's C clients built on libmosquitto — a
//! separate implementation by a separate project in a separate language. Nothing
//! this server links against appears anywhere in that binary, so a session it
//! completes is independent evidence rather than one codec agreeing with itself.
//!
//! What the test drives is a whole broker session, not a handshake:
//!
//! ```text
//!   mosquitto_sub  CONNECT  -> CONNACK    (the model chose return code 0)
//!                  SUBSCRIBE-> SUBACK     (granted QoS echoed against its packet id)
//!   mosquitto_pub  CONNECT  -> CONNACK
//!                  PUBLISH  -> (broker-originated PUBLISH to the subscriber)
//!   mosquitto_sub  prints the payload on stdout
//! ```
//!
//! The final assertion is on what `mosquitto_sub` *printed*, which is the point: a
//! raw socket can be told any bytes arrived, but libmosquitto only prints a payload
//! it successfully parsed out of a PUBLISH whose remaining-length, topic length and
//! flags it accepted.
//!
//! This test is **not** `#[ignore]`d and does **not** skip when mosquitto is
//! missing — see `require_binary`.
