//! What an MQTT client gets when the LLM backend fails - and the fail-open this closed.
//!
//! MQTT collapsed "the handler ran and declined to decide" and "the handler could not run" into
//! one outcome, `Silent`, and then applied the permissive default for it. For CONNECT that
//! default is `build_connack(0, ...)`, which is **Connection Accepted**: an LLM outage
//! authenticated every client that asked, credentials included, and a model's explicit refusal
//! was indistinguishable from the backend being down. SUBSCRIBE was the same shape one level
//! down - the default granted every requested QoS on every filter, so an outage made the
//! subscription decision.
//!
//! The permissive defaults are correct for a handler that ran and said nothing. They are only
//! reachable now when that is what happened.
//!
//! MQTT 3.1.1's refusals, and why each one:
//!
//! * CONNECT -> CONNACK return code 3, "server unavailable" (§3.2.2.3), then close, which the
//!   spec requires after any non-zero CONNACK.
//! * SUBSCRIBE -> SUBACK return code 0x80, "failure" (§3.9.3), one per filter. This is the
//!   only per-request failure code 3.1.1 has.
//! * PUBLISH / UNSUBSCRIBE -> close the connection. PUBACK and UNSUBACK are a bare packet
//!   identifier with no failure code, and sending one would tell the client its message was
//!   taken or its subscriptions were removed. Closing instead leaves QoS 1/2 redelivery to do
//!   its job.
//!
//! The packets below are built and decoded by hand against the spec rather than with a client
//! library, because the assertion is about specific bytes in specific positions.
