//! The connection cap and the read deadlines on a real, running MQTT broker, driven from the
//! wire.
//!
//! An MQTT connection is a *session*, not a request: a subscriber holds its socket open for the
//! life of the application, so this broker's live-connection count is its client count rather
//! than its arrival rate. Until September 2026 that count had no ceiling — the accept loop
//! admitted every connection offered to it, before any CONNECT.
//!
//! Three claims, and the second is where the version question lands:
//!
//! 1. `MAX_CONNECTIONS` peers are admitted.
//! 2. The next one is refused with **CONNACK return code 3, "Server unavailable"** — the one
//!    code MQTT defines for "I am working, come back later", and the same one this broker
//!    already sends when a handler refuses a CONNECT. The framing is 3.1.1's, which is not a
//!    guess about the peer: `build_connack` is this broker's single CONNACK site and has no
//!    version parameter, so a peer that could have completed a session here is a peer that
//!    accepts this shape. 3.1.1 §3.2 then requires the server to close, which it does.
//! 3. Closing an admitted connection **frees exactly one slot**. This is the claim that matters
//!    most here, because one MQTT connection is *two* tasks — the session and the writer it
//!    spawns — so the permit is an `Arc` held by both and released by whichever ends last.
//!    Holding it in the session alone would release the slot while a writer was still draining.
//!
//! **How this was proved to fail without the cap**: replace the `accept_bounded` call in
//! `src/server/mqtt/mod.rs` with a bare `listener.accept().await` (and drop the permit). The
//! over-cap peer is then admitted and, having sent no CONNECT, is answered with nothing — so
//! the `read_to_end` times out and the test fails on "was neither answered nor closed".
//!
//! # The read deadlines
//!
//! Each asserted from the peer's side, with the startup parameters set short:
//!
//! * **No CONNECT within `first_byte_timeout_secs`** — the peer is closed (3.1.1 §3.1.4).
//! * **A session with a non-zero Keep Alive** is closed after 1.5x of it with no packet from the
//!   client (§3.1.2.10, a MUST), and a session that keeps sending PINGREQ inside that window is
//!   *not* closed. The other two bounds are set long, so a test that passed on either of them
//!   would time out instead.
//! * **A session that declared Keep Alive 0** is closed at `idle_timeout_secs` instead, so the
//!   client cannot switch the bound off in its own CONNECT.
//! * **A packet parked for a human keeps its session**, far past 1.5x Keep Alive: packets are
//!   dispatched inline, so the read — and the deadline around it — is not running while the
//!   answer is composed.
//!
//! Removing the `timeout` around the read in `handle_mqtt_connection` makes the first three
//! hang to their windows; the fourth is the pin against the deadline being moved outward to
//! cover dispatch as well.
//!
//! The broker is model-free: an empty instruction really is model-free, where `None` is replaced
//! by a default one. MQTT is client-speaks-first, so a peer that never sends CONNECT provokes no
//! model call. Loopback only.
//!
//! Run with:
//!   ./cargo-isolated.sh test --no-default-features --features mqtt --test server -- mqtt::connection_bounds --test-threads=100
