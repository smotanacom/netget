//! E2E tests for MQTT protocol
//!
//! These tests verify MQTT broker functionality by starting NetGet with MQTT prompts
//! and using rumqttc client library to connect and publish/subscribe.
//!
//! NOTE: MQTT broker is currently a placeholder implementation. These tests verify
//! that the protocol is registered and returns appropriate error messages.
//! Once full broker implementation is complete, these tests will be updated to
//! validate actual MQTT functionality.

///  * **`mqtt_suback` must echo `packet_id` from the event.** rumqttc blocks until a SUBACK
///    carrying the packet id it chose arrives, so a hardcoded id stalls the subscribe forever.
///    Hence `respond_with_actions_from_event`, the same reason the UDP-style protocols need it.
///  * **The event `mqtt_publish` and the action `mqtt_publish` share a name and are opposite
///    directions.** The event is the client's PUBLISH arriving at the broker; the action is the
///    broker sending one out. Answering the event with the action is what forwards the message.
