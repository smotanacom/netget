//! BLE data-stream startup-example coherence, checked without a spec or an adapter.
//!
//! This profile's startup examples use **custom** UUIDs with no Bluetooth SIG layout behind
//! them, so there is no independent specification to check the value bytes against, and a test
//! that restated them would assert only that the literals equal themselves. What *is* checkable
//! without a spec — and without a Bluetooth adapter — is whether the example is internally
//! coherent: whether the handlers it routes can ever match the service it builds.
//!
//! That is not a hypothetical. The sibling file-transfer profile routed `bluetooth_read_request` to
//! a fixed `respond_to_read` while both of its characteristics were write/notify — a handler
//! that could never match anything, sitting in the example as if it worked.
//!
//! These tests need no Bluetooth adapter, so they are not ignored.
