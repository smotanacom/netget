//! HLS's declared `max_inbound_bytes` — `MAX_REQUEST_HEAD_BYTES` — driven from the wire.
//!
//! The request head is the only thing an HLS peer sends that the server reads: players send
//! bodiless GETs, and a request that declares a body is refused with 413 before any of it is
//! read. So:
//!
//! 1. **`bound` is accepted**: a GET whose head is exactly `MAX_REQUEST_HEAD_BYTES` long (padded
//!    with one long header) reaches the model as a segment request.
//! 2. **`bound + 1` is refused before the model**: the same head one byte longer is answered
//!    `431 Request Header Fields Too Large` and closed, with zero model calls.
//! 3. **A declared body is refused unread**: `POST` with `Content-Length` gets 413 and no model
//!    call — what `max_inbound_bytes_bound_plus_one_test`'s HTTP-body probe meets.
//! 4. **The server still serves**: a fresh GET reaches the model.
//!
//! **Verified by removal.** With the `len <= MAX_REQUEST_HEAD_BYTES` / `buffer.len() >
//! MAX_REQUEST_HEAD_BYTES` checks made to accept anything, assertion 2 fails (the over-bound
//! head reaches the model); with `declares_body` returning `None`, assertion 3 fails.
//!
//! Run with:
//!   ./cargo-isolated.sh test --no-default-features --features hls --test server -- hls::inbound_limit --test-threads=100
