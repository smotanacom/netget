//! A script rule that cannot answer must be **charged**, and this file counts the calls.
//!
//! RTP's budget gate used to ask `find_handler` what was *configured*. A `Script` rule read as
//! "answers in-process, costs no model call", so `RtpLlmBudget` was skipped outright — and then
//! `action_helper::call_llm` dispatched the very same handler itself. When
//! `execute_script_handler` answered `FallbackToLlm` — an unknown language name, a missing
//! interpreter, a script that threw — the model was consulted with the budget already bypassed.
//!
//! On RTP that is the worst place for it: a single G.711 stream is 50 packets per second, so
//! the hole is 50 uncounted consultations a second, `llm_max_per_minute` is inert at every
//! setting including `0`, and each consultation can authorize up to 30 seconds of outbound
//! media — an amplifier for anyone who spoofs a source address.
//!
//! # The measurement
//!
//! One configuration — a `*`-matching script rule whose language the executor does not know —
//! run at two ceilings, against a mock model that records every call it receives:
//!
//! | `llm_max_per_minute` | old code (gate skipped on configuration) | this code |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | 30 | N calls | **N calls** (measured by `script_that_cannot_answer_reaches_the_model_when_the_budget_allows`) |
//! | 0 | N calls — the gate was never consulted | **0 calls** (measured by `script_that_cannot_answer_is_charged_to_the_budget`) |
//!
//! The ample-ceiling row is what makes the zero mean something: it proves the datagrams arrive,
//! that this handler really does fall through to the model, and that the mock counts. The old
//! code produced that same N at *both* ceilings, because it never reached the gate — which
//! [`the_configuration_and_the_answer_disagree`] pins directly by asking the two questions of
//! one configuration and showing they give opposite answers.
//!
//! Run with:
//!   ./cargo-isolated.sh test --no-default-features --features rtp \
//!       --test server::rtp::script_fallback_budget_test -- --test-threads=100
