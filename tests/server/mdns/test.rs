//! End-to-end mDNS tests for NetGet
//!
//! These tests spawn the actual NetGet binary with mDNS prompts and validate the
//! advertisements with an `mdns-sd` browser.
//!
//! ## These tests used to assert nothing
//!
//! Every one of them computed a `found_service` flag and then **printed** it:
//!
//! ```ignore
//! if found_service { println!("✓ verified"); } else { println!("Note: not discovered"); }
//! ```
//!
//! so the suite was green whether or not a single byte was advertised, and mDNS's
//! `metadata().e2e_testing` claimed they were "asserting on ServiceResolved" when nothing
//! was asserted at all. `verify_mocks()` was the only real check, and it proves the startup
//! LLM call happened — not that anything reached the multicast group.
//!
//! Two further defects the rewrite fixed, both of which would have survived a naive
//! `assert!(found_service)`:
//!
//! - **They accepted a neighbour's advertisement.** Browsing `_http._tcp.local.` returns
//!   every such service on the link, and these four tests run concurrently and advertise
//!   into it. A run captured here had `test_mdns_service_advertisement` report
//!   `Instance: Web Service._http._tcp.local.` — the service belonging to
//!   `test_mdns_multiple_services` — and call itself verified. Every wait now matches on the
//!   instance name it registered.
//! - **The wait loop broke on the wrong event.** `ServiceFound` arrives before
//!   `ServiceResolved`, and the `_ => break` arm treated it as a reason to stop, so a
//!   service that was about to resolve was abandoned.
//!
//! ## What this evidence is worth
//!
//! `mdns-sd` is the crate the **server** uses, so this is one crate round-tripping through
//! itself — the same circularity that keeps `websocket` and `webrtc_signaling` out of Beta,
//! and that `rss` escaped only by parsing with `feed-rs` instead. It is real coverage of
//! NetGet's registration plumbing (startup params → `ServiceInfo` → the group) and it is not
//! evidence of interop. `mdns` is rated Experimental for that reason. An independent peer
//! would be the platform tool — `dns-sd -L` on macOS, `avahi-browse -r` on Linux — which is
//! what a promotion to Beta needs.
