//! mDNS is the case where silence is the *right* answer - and this test pins that down.
//!
//! Every other protocol in this sweep answers its peer when the LLM backend fails, because a
//! peer blocked on a reply is worse off than one told no. mDNS is not that shape twice over:
//!
//! * There is no peer waiting. The LLM call here is a **startup** event asking which services
//!   to advertise, not a reply to a querier. Nobody is holding a socket open for it.
//! * An mDNS answer is multicast to the whole link, and every listener caches the record for
//!   its TTL. A fabricated PTR/SRV/A set would advertise a service that does not exist to
//!   every machine on the subnet and keep it there after the backend recovered. That is the
//!   `udp` argument - an invented reply may be parsed as a real one - one step worse, because
//!   the damage outlives the outage and reaches hosts that never asked.
//!
//! So the responder comes up advertising nothing. What must *not* happen, and used to, is
//! swallowing the failure: `if let Ok(..)` discarded the error entirely, so the daemon ran and
//! said nothing about why it had no services. This test asserts both halves - the responder
//! starts, and the failure is reported at ERROR on the status channel with
//! `decision=fail_closed_llm_error`.
//!
//! The wire half of that pair cannot be a `recv()` that times out: this server binds no socket
//! of its own (`mdns-sd` owns them and exposes none), and the only thing it could put on the
//! link is an announcement. So "nothing reached the wire" is asserted as "no service was ever
//! registered with the daemon" - if nothing is registered there is nothing to announce - which
//! is the strongest statement available without a second host on the link.
