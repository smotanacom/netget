//! What a UDP peer gets when the LLM backend fails: deliberately nothing.
//!
//! This is the one protocol in the failure-response sweep where silence is the *correct*
//! answer, and the test exists to pin that decision rather than to leave it looking like an
//! oversight.
//!
//! Bare UDP (RFC 768) has no error frame, no transaction identifier, and no application
//! semantics. The server does not know what the datagram meant, so any bytes it invented could
//! be parsed as a real reply by whatever protocol the peer is actually speaking - a worse
//! failure than dropping it, because the peer would act on the answer. Dropping a datagram is
//! also normal UDP behaviour that every UDP client already copes with.
//!
//! Protocols layered on UDP that *do* have an error form must use it, and do: see the SERVFAIL,
//! Kiss-o'-Death and STUN 500 tests beside this one.
//!
//! So what is asserted here is the pair: nothing on the wire, and a loud, specific log line
//! saying why. A silent drop with no log would be indistinguishable from the defect.
