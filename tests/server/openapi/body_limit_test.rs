//! An OpenAPI server takes unauthenticated POSTs whose bodies it buffers whole.
//!
//! `hyper`'s `Incoming` has no default limit, so `req.into_body().collect()` read whatever the
//! peer chose to send, and the body then goes into the `openapi_request` event and from there
//! into an LLM prompt.
//!
//! The old error arm was worse than merely unbounded: it swallowed the read failure into
//! `Bytes::new()` and carried on, so the model was shown a request with *no* body and answered
//! it as though the peer had sent none. That is the truncated-body trap — the model answers a
//! request it never saw — and it is why the cap returns a distinct 413 rather than an empty
//! body.
