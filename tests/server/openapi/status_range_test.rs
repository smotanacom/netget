//! A model-supplied `status_code` narrowed with `as u16` asserted the opposite outcome.
//!
//! Both executors read the field with `as_i64()` and then narrowed it, which wraps in both
//! directions: `65736 as u16` is `200`, and `-1 as u16` is `65535`. `send_validation_error`
//! is the model's way of saying a request failed schema validation, so the single field
//! carrying that refusal could reach the client as the success it was refusing.
//!
//! The executor refuses an out-of-range status rather than clamping it, and names the range
//! so the repair loop can correct the call.
