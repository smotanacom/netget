//! The read deadlines on a real, running BitTorrent peer-wire server, driven from a raw socket.
//!
//! Three claims, and the first two pull in opposite directions.
//!
//! **A peer that has connected and sent no handshake must eventually be let go of.** Nothing
//! else in the process will close that socket: it holds a task, an `AppState` row and one of
//! `MAX_CONNECTIONS` slots, before it has identified itself with so much as an info-hash. Remove
//! the deadline around the read in `src/server/torrent_peer/mod.rs` and the first test hangs
//! until its own window expires.
//!
//! **But the default must not be short enough to deadlock against NetGet's own peer client.**
//! `src/client/torrent_peer/mod.rs` connects and its read loop's *first* act is `read_exact` on
//! the other side's 68-byte handshake; sending its own is only the `send_handshake` action,
//! which needs a model turn or a person at `[ send message ]`. A client created from the
//! dashboard's `[ + torrent_peer client ]` is routed `torrent_peer_connected` →
//! static-with-no-actions and then `*` → manual (`src/tui/modal/form.rs`), so it connects and
//! waits. Both ends are then in `read`, and at the 30 seconds this bound used to carry it was
//! this end that gave up — while the operator was still reading the parked event that would
//! have unblocked it. The third test is the regression for that and is deliberately slow:
//! proving a peer survives *past* the old bound means waiting past it.
//!
//! **And the two bounds are different claims**, so the second test completes a handshake and
//! then goes quiet, which must be governed by `idle_timeout_secs` rather than by the first-byte
//! one. Its handshake is answered by a static routing rule, so no model is involved.
//!
//! The values the first two tests use are *overrides*, not the defaults. `HANDSHAKE_READ_TIMEOUT`
//! is 300 seconds — the window a `manual` rule gives a human (`src/state/intercepts.rs`) — and a
//! test that asserted it by waiting it out would be the slowest thing in the suite. That is why
//! both bounds are declared startup parameters: what is asserted here is that each parameter is
//! read and applied to the read it names; the *values* are argued where they are declared.
//!
//! No mock backend: the LLM endpoint is a dead port. These tests assert on deadlines, not on
//! answers. Loopback only.
//!
//! Run with:
//!   ./cargo-isolated.sh test --no-default-features --features torrent-peer --test server -- \
//!       torrent_peer::connection_bounds --test-threads=100
