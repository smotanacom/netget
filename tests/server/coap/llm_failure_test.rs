//! What a CoAP client gets when the model cannot answer, and how the two ways that happens
//! are told apart.
//!
//! `src/server/coap/CLAUDE.md` describes a `decision=` vocabulary modelled on
//! `src/server/radius/`: 5.03 Service Unavailable is what **both** fail-closed paths put on the
//! wire *and* a code the model may legitimately choose for itself, so the peer cannot tell the
//! three apart and the log is the only place the distinction survives. Until this file existed
//! nothing asserted any of it — `tests/server/coap/CLAUDE.md` listed "no test of the 5.03
//! fail-closed path" as a gap, and a documented decision table nothing checks is the shape this
//! repository keeps finding in `metadata()` claims.
//!
//! Two paths, one server:
//!
//! * **`fail_closed_llm_error`** — the backend failed. Forced by configuring a mock for the
//!   *startup* instruction only, so the `coap_request` event matches no rule, the mock answers
//!   HTTP 500, and `call_llm` returns `Err`.
//! * **`fail_closed_no_action`** — the model answered, and with nothing this protocol can send.
//!   `show_message` is a *common* action, so it never enters `protocol_results` and
//!   `outcome_from_results` finds no `coap_response`, `coap_reset` or `coap_ignore`.
//!
//! The assertion that matters is not "it answered 5.03" — a server that answered 5.03 to
//! everything would satisfy that, and so would one whose model genuinely chose 5.03. It is that
//! the reply is **matchable** (ACK type, the request's message id, the request's token) and that
//! the log says which of the two happened.
