//! The SCTP refusal is a feature, so it gets a test.
//!
//! M3UA's transport is SCTP (RFC 4666 section 1.4.1). macOS has no SCTP stack at all, and macOS
//! is where this code is developed and run. The `bluetooth_ble_beacon` precedent in the root
//! `CLAUDE.md` says what to do about that: **hiding a protocol is not the same as refusing to
//! start it.** Refused, the operator gets `ServerStatus::Error` naming the reason; hidden,
//! nobody ever learns why the thing does not work.
//!
//! So `spawn()` must fail, and fail *legibly*: naming SCTP, naming the RFC, and naming the
//! non-standard TCP escape hatch. An errno on its own ("Protocol not supported") tells an
//! operator nothing about what to do next.
//!
//! These tests bind no ports of consequence and make no LLM calls.
