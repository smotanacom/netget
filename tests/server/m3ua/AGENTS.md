# M3UA Test Strategy

Three files, three different kinds of evidence. Read
[`src/server/m3ua/CLAUDE.md`](../../../src/server/m3ua/CLAUDE.md) first — in particular the
transport section, which is what limits what any of this can prove.

| File | What it is evidence of | LLM calls |
|---|---|---|
| `codec_test.rs` | the wire format matches RFC 4666, asserted against literal octets | 0 |
| `transport_test.rs` | the SCTP refusal happens, and says something useful | 0 |
| `e2e_test.rs` | the association, the state machine and the fail-closed rule, over the **lab** transport | 7 |

## The ceiling on all of it

**M3UA runs over SCTP and macOS has no SCTP stack.** Nothing in this directory has ever run over
the protocol's real transport, and no test here is evidence of interoperability with a real
SIGTRAN peer — there is none to run against, and the one the e2e tests do run against speaks TCP,
which no real ASP does.

That is not a gap to be closed by writing more tests here. It is closed on Linux, against
`osmo-stp` / `libosmo-sigtran`. Until then the protocol stays `Experimental`, and any claim
otherwise should be treated as the `wireguard` bug the root `CLAUDE.md` records: a maturity
rating resting on a test that never exercised the thing it claimed.

## `codec_test.rs` — why literal octets, not round-trips

Every expected vector is **written out by hand from RFC 4666**, field by field, with the decode
in the comment. Round-tripping NetGet's encoder through NetGet's decoder would pass just as
happily if both were wrong in the same way — the root `CLAUDE.md` names that as circular
evidence, and for M3UA it is not hypothetical.

The rule at stake is RFC 4666 section 3.2: **the Parameter Length excludes the padding that
rounds a parameter to a 4-octet boundary.** A two-octet value declares 6 and occupies 8. An
implementation that writes 8 there decodes its own traffic perfectly and corrupts every real
peer's, and no round-trip test would ever notice. `parameter_length_excludes_padding_but_message_
length_includes_it` asserts both numbers in the same test on purpose.

`data_encodes_the_routing_label_and_pads_the_user_part` is the consequential case: 15 octets of
Protocol Data declare 19 and occupy 20, and
`decoded_payload_never_includes_the_padding_octet` asserts the receive side of the same thing —
a padding octet delivered as user part is a corrupted ISUP message.

Two tests feed in messages **NetGet did not encode**
(`parses_a_hand_written_data_message_into_structured_fields`,
`parses_a_hand_written_aspup_with_asp_identifier_and_info_string`). That direction is the
genuinely non-circular one, since the input comes from the RFC.

If you add a vector: write the octets first from the RFC, then run it. If you find yourself
copying the encoder's output into the expectation, the test has stopped being evidence.

## `transport_test.rs` — the refusal is a feature

`sctp_transport_either_works_or_refuses_by_name` passes on **both** kinds of host, and asserts
something different on each. On a host without SCTP the error must name SCTP, RFC 4666, the
`transport="tcp"` escape hatch, and the fact that the escape hatch is `NON-STANDARD` — an errno
alone leaves an operator stuck. On a host with SCTP it must produce a bound listener, and it
asserts the host is not macOS, because a `SOCK_STREAM`/`IPPROTO_SCTP` socket succeeding there
would mean the probe is not probing.

`nothing_defaults_to_the_lab_transport` guards the direction that would be silent: if the
default ever flipped to TCP, an operator on a host *with* SCTP would get the lab framing without
asking, which is exactly what the refusal exists to prevent.

None of these bind a port of consequence or make an LLM call, so they are cheap and can be run
on their own:

```bash
./cargo-isolated.sh test --no-default-features --features m3ua \
    --test server -- server::m3ua::transport_test --test-threads=100
```

## `e2e_test.rs` — budget and what each test pins

Seven LLM calls across three tests, each a separate NetGet process.

**`test_m3ua_asp_comes_up_activates_and_exchanges_data`** (4 calls: startup, ASPUP, ASPAC, DATA).
The protocol end to end. The DATA rule uses `respond_with_actions_from_event` and swaps the point
codes and echoes the SLS — reading those fields off the event is simultaneously the assertion
that the routing label arrived as *structured fields* rather than as a blob. The reply's payload
is sent as `"0a0b0c"` with `encoding: "hex"` and asserted on the wire as three octets, which is
the `send_tcp_data` bug in miniature: had the executor not decoded the hex, six ASCII characters
would have gone out instead.

**BEAT and ASPIA are in this test precisely because they must cost nothing.** They are answered
in Rust; a fifth model call would have gone unmatched, and `verify_mocks` is what turns that into
a failure. Do not add a mock rule for them "just in case" — that would delete the assertion.

**`test_m3ua_silence_does_not_admit_an_asp`** (2 calls: startup, ASPUP). The policy answers
`wait_for_more`. NetGet must answer ERR `0x0d` and leave the ASP DOWN, and the ASPAC that follows
must be refused as `0x06 Unexpected Message` with **no** second model call. It also asserts
`decision=model_silent` appears in the log: the wire carries a category, and only the log can say
which of the non-answers it was.

**`test_m3ua_refuses_when_no_policy_is_configured`** (1 call: startup). `open_server` with an
empty instruction and no handlers. The ASPUP is refused and the log says
`decision=no_policy_configured`, with `verify_mocks` proving the ASPUP cost no call — there was
nothing to ask. This pins the deliberate difference from BGP, which treats the same situation as
a static default and completes its handshake.

### Rules for adding tests here

- **Distinct events per rule.** Mock rules are first-match-wins, and two rules on the same event
  with no way to tell them apart is the most common mistake in this repo. To express "then", use
  one rule with `respond_with_actions_from_event` that branches on the event.
- **`wait_for_mocks(30)` then `verify_mocks().await?`**, always. Without the second, the test
  asserts nothing about LLM interaction.
- **Build messages by hand, not through `codec`.** The helpers in `e2e_test.rs`
  (`m3ua_message`, `protocol_data`, `find_param`) reimplement the framing from the RFC, so the
  server's decoder is fed something it did not produce. Calling into `netget::server::m3ua::codec`
  here would make the e2e tests circular too.
- **127.0.0.1 and port 0 only**, and `transport: "tcp"` — the SCTP transport cannot bind on this
  machine, so a test that omits it will fail at startup, correctly.

## Running

```bash
# everything
./cargo-isolated.sh test --no-default-features --features m3ua \
    --test server -- server::m3ua --test-threads=100

# just the codec (no sockets, no processes, instant)
./cargo-isolated.sh test --no-default-features --features m3ua \
    --test server -- server::m3ua::codec_test --test-threads=100
```

The whole-tree ratchets are worth running after any change to `actions.rs`, since they walk the
registry rather than this suite:

```bash
for t in event_action_declarations_test executable_examples_test event_emit_sites_test \
         startup_param_drift_test wire_failure_test; do
  ./cargo-isolated.sh test --no-default-features --features tcp,m3ua --test $t -- --test-threads=100
done
```

`tcp,m3ua` rather than `m3ua` alone: two of those tests assert their own coverage against a
minimum protocol count and fail vacuously in a one-feature build. That failure is pre-existing
and is not about M3UA — `executable_examples_test::the_example_audit_has_something_to_inspect`
wants more than 900 examples in the build and only reaches that at `--all-features`.
