//! The connection cap on a real, running AMQP broker, driven from the wire.
//!
//! `HANDSHAKE_TIMEOUT_SECS` (30s) and `IDLE_READ_TIMEOUT_SECS` (600s) bound how long *one* peer
//! holds a connection; neither says anything about how many such peers there may be, and until
//! September 2026 this accept loop admitted every connection offered to it. An AMQP connection
//! is four tasks and up to `MAX_OPEN_CHANNELS` channels each buffering toward `MAX_BODY_SIZE`,
//! so an unbounded number of them is an unbounded multiplier on a bound this broker already
//! took care to declare.
//!
//! Three claims:
//!
//! 1. `MAX_CONNECTIONS` peers are admitted.
//! 2. The next one is refused with a connection-level `Connection.Close` on channel 0 carrying
//!    reply code 320 `CONNECTION_FORCED`, and then closed. The expected frame is rebuilt here
//!    from AMQP 0-9-1's framing rules rather than imported from `codec.rs`, so this asserts
//!    against the spec and not against the encoder that produced it.
//! 3. Closing an admitted connection **frees exactly one slot**. A permit dropped before the
//!    connection ends un-caps the broker silently; one never released wedges it shut after
//!    `MAX_CONNECTIONS` peers have ever connected.
//!
//! **Why a frame rather than silence, tested here rather than argued once**: the method's
//! `class-id`/`method-id` fields are zero when the close answers no method (0-9-1 §1.4.2.9),
//! which is exactly a peer over the cap — so nothing in this refusal is fabricated, unlike an
//! IPP status or a MongoDB reply that would have to invent a request id. The test asserts those
//! two zero fields for that reason.
//!
//! **How this was proved to fail without the cap**: replace the `accept_bounded` call in
//! `src/server/amqp/mod.rs` with a bare `listener.accept().await` (and drop the permit from the
//! connection task). The over-cap peer is then admitted, sits waiting for a protocol header it
//! will never be asked for, and the test fails on the read timing out.
//!
//! The server is model-free: an empty instruction really is model-free, where `None` is
//! replaced by a default one. AMQP is client-speaks-first — the broker waits for the 8-byte
//! protocol header — so a peer that says nothing provokes no model call. Loopback only.
//!
//! Run with:
//!   ./cargo-isolated.sh test --no-default-features --features amqp --test server -- amqp::connection_bounds --test-threads=100
