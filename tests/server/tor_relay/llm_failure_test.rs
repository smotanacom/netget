//! What a Tor peer gets when the LLM backend fails.
//!
//! The failure is forced the way `tests/server/dns/llm_failure_test.rs` forces it: mocks are
//! configured for the startup instruction and for `tor_relay_circuit_created` only, so the
//! circuit comes up normally and then the `tor_relay_relay_cell` event matches no rule, the
//! mock Ollama server answers HTTP 500, and `call_llm` returns `Err`.
//!
//! That event fires for RELAY commands the relay does not implement itself — EXTEND, TRUNCATE,
//! RESOLVE, DROP — so the model *is* the whole answer, and `if let Ok(execution_result) = ...`
//! meant the peer got nothing at all: a circuit that had accepted its cell and would never
//! speak again, until the client's own timeout.
//!
//! Tor's vocabulary for "this relay cannot carry on with your circuit" is a DESTROY cell
//! (tor-spec 5.4) carrying a reason, and reason 2 INTERNAL is precisely "an error at the
//! relay". It also needs no relay-cell encryption, so it is deliverable even when the circuit
//! crypto is what is unhappy. The assertion below is on the bytes of that cell.
//!
//! Everything here is 127.0.0.1. The real Tor network is never contacted, and no exit stream
//! is opened.
