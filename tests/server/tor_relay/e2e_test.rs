//! End-to-end test for the Tor relay: a real ntor client, a real circuit, a real exit stream.
//!
//! The peer here is a Tor client written from tor-spec in this file — the ntor handshake
//! (5.1.4), its 92-byte KDF layout (5.2.2) and AES-128-CTR relay-cell crypto (6.1) — not a
//! call into the server's own `circuit.rs`. That independence is the whole point: if the
//! relay's key derivation, its direction assignment, or its cell layout is wrong by a single
//! byte, this client derives different keys, the AUTH check fails, and the test fails.
//!
//! What it proves:
//!
//! - The reader frames an 11-byte VERSIONS cell (2-byte circuit id, variable length) instead
//!   of blocking on a 514-byte `read_exact`, and answers it.
//! - CREATE2/CREATED2 completes a genuine Curve25519 ntor handshake whose server AUTH value
//!   this client recomputes and checks.
//! - RELAY/BEGIN opens a real TCP stream to a localhost HTTP server and answers CONNECTED.
//! - RELAY/DATA carries an HTTP request out and the response back, decrypting correctly with
//!   the backward key — which means Kf/Kb are the right way round and the keystreams stay in
//!   step across cells.
//!
//! What it does **not** prove, and why this protocol stays `Experimental`: the link handshake
//! stops after VERSIONS (no CERTS / AUTH_CHALLENGE / NETINFO), relay-cell digests are never
//! computed or verified, and there is no EXTEND — so a real `tor` binary still cannot use
//! this relay. Those are listed in `src/server/tor_relay/CLAUDE.md`.
