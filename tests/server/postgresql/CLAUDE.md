# PostgreSQL Protocol E2E Tests

Four files, all declared in `tests/server/postgresql/mod.rs`. The peer is always
`tokio-postgres` — an independent implementation of the wire protocol, not the
`pgwire` crate the server frames with, so nothing here is circular.

| File | What it proves | LLM calls |
|---|---|---|
| `test.rs` | Four simple-query cases through the mock-model harness | 8 |
| `extended_query_test.rs` | Parse/Describe/Bind/Execute really works | 0 |
| `decoder_panic_test.rs` | A pgwire panic is contained; counters move | 0 |
| `llm_failure_test.rs` | The SQLSTATE a driver sees when the backend fails | 1 |

## Running

`--test` names a **target**, not a module path. `--test server::postgresql::test`
makes cargo list its targets and exit having run nothing — it does not fail, so
it silently looks like a pass. Use `--test server` and filter afterwards:

```bash
./cargo-isolated.sh test --no-default-features --features postgresql \
    --test server -- server::postgresql --test-threads=100
```

## The two protocols, and why that distinction cost a real bug

PostgreSQL has two query protocols, and **which one a test uses decides what it
can detect**:

- `client.simple_query(...)` sends a single `Query` message. There is no format
  negotiation: every cell is text, always.
- `client.query(...)` / `client.prepare(...)` send Parse → Describe → Bind →
  Execute. The Bind names the wire format of **each result column**, and
  tokio-postgres asks for **binary**.

Every test in `test.rs` used `simple_query`. The server hardcoded
`FieldFormat::Text` for the RowDescription and for every cell, so it was correct
for the only path under test and wrong for the other one: `client.query` against
any non-text column returned `error deserializing column 0`.

That symptom was recorded in this file for a long time as *"Extended Query
Protocol Timeout (CRITICAL) … Status: **UNRESOLVED** - root cause unknown"*,
with the advice to "use simple queries instead" — which is what kept the suite
away from the one path that would have shown the defect. It was never a timeout.
`extended_query_test.rs` exists so that cannot recur, and it runs with **no LLM
in the loop at all** (a `*` static handler), so a hang there is unambiguously
ours.

**The general lesson**: when a protocol has two paths and the suite only exercises
one, "works" means "works on the tested path". This is the same shape as the MySQL
prepared-statement defect found in the same pass — there, every test used
`conn.query*` (text protocol) and `conn.exec*` (binary) had never worked.

## Zero-LLM tests

`extended_query_test.rs` and `decoder_panic_test.rs` build their servers directly
through `ServerForm` with a `*` static handler, rather than through the
mock-model harness.

Both pass **`instruction: Some(String::new())`**. This is load-bearing:
`ServerForm::create` substitutes a default instruction (`"You are a {protocol}
server…"`) whenever `instruction` is `None`, and any non-empty instruction makes
`operator_wants_dynamic` true — so a server built with `..Default::default()`
consults the model whatever the test's comments claim. Two `peer_inject` tests
elsewhere in this repo documented "Zero LLM calls" while doing the opposite.

The one exception is
`an_unanswerable_extended_query_errors_rather_than_returning_no_rows`, which
deliberately *does* want a model it cannot reach: it sets a real instruction and
no handlers, pointing at a closed port, to assert the extended path fails closed
rather than answering with an empty result set.

## LLM call budget

`test.rs`: 4 tests × (1 startup + 1 query) = **8 calls**.
`llm_failure_test.rs`: **1 call** (the startup; the query call is answered 500 on
purpose). Total **9**, under the ~10 guideline.

`extended_query_test.rs` and `decoder_panic_test.rs` cost **0** — they neither
start a netget subprocess nor reach a model.

## Waiting

The mocked suites call `wait_for_mocks(30)` before `verify_mocks()`: a protocol
exchange finishes with the last LLM call it provokes, so waiting on the
expectations waits on the exchange. The zero-LLM suites poll for the condition —
a bound port, a closed connection row, a non-zero counter — rather than sleeping.

## Failure semantics under test

`llm_failure_test.rs` asserts the peer gets an `ErrorResponse` with a SQLSTATE
rather than silence, and reads it back through tokio-postgres.
`an_unanswerable_extended_query_errors_rather_than_returning_no_rows` additionally
asserts the message is netget's own `WireFailure` category and that it leaks no
backend URL, model name or transport error text — the peer gets a category, the
log gets the error.

## Not covered

- **Authentication and TLS** — the server implements neither.
- **Bound parameter values.** `$1` placeholders reach the model as literal text;
  `do_describe_statement` reports zero parameters, so a driver that binds real
  parameters gets a statement it believes takes none.
- **`COPY`, `LISTEN`/`NOTIFY`, cursors/`FETCH`, arrays and composite types.**
- **Multi-statement simple queries** return a single response, not one per
  statement.
- **psql, psycopg or any other real client binary.** tokio-postgres is a genuine
  third-party implementation and is what the rating rests on; a
  skip-when-missing gate around a binary would not be evidence anyway.
