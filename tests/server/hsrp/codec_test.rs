//! Pure HSRP codec tests — no socket, no LLM, no `AppState`.
//!
//! `e2e_test.rs` already pins both wire layouts byte for byte through a running server. What
//! lives here is the part that needs no server at all: the treatment of the **plaintext
//! authentication field**, which is the one place in HSRP where a string crosses between the
//! wire, the model and a log line.
//!
//! Run with:
//!   ./cargo-isolated.sh test --no-default-features --features hsrp \
//!       --test server hsrp::codec_test -- --test-threads=100
