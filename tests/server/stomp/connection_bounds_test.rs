//! The read deadlines and the connection cap on a real, running STOMP server, from the wire.
//!
//! Before September 2026 this server accepted without limit and bounded no read in time: a peer
//! that connected and said nothing held a socket, a connection task and an `AppState` entry
//! forever — before `CONNECT`, so before the model had decided anything about it — on a server
//! that would happily accept a hundred more.
//!
//! Three properties are asserted, and each one alone would be satisfied by a bug:
//!
//! 1. A peer that connects and **says nothing** is closed at `FIRST_FRAME_READ_TIMEOUT`, and
//!    told so with an `ERROR` frame rather than dropped.
//! 2. A peer that has **connected** survives well past that same bound. STOMP's own reason for
//!    the two numbers to differ is that a subscriber sends `SUBSCRIBE` once and then only
//!    receives; collapsing them would cut every subscription at 30 seconds.
//! 3. The connection past `MAX_CONNECTIONS` is refused with a well-formed `ERROR` frame — the
//!    protocol's own vocabulary — and releasing one admitted connection frees exactly one slot.
//!
//! **How this was proved to fail without the bound**: replace the `tokio::time::timeout(...)`
//! around `reader.read(...)` in `src/server/stomp/mod.rs` with the bare call and the first test
//! hangs for its whole 70-second window, then fails with "still holding the socket".
//!
//! Run with:
//!   ./cargo-isolated.sh test --no-default-features --features stomp,tcp --test server -- stomp::connection_bounds --test-threads=100
