//! The DNS server, driven by `dig` — a DNS client NetGet shares no code with.
//!
//! ## Why this file exists
//!
//! `tests/server/dns/test.rs` drives the server with **hickory-client**, and the server
//! builds every response with **hickory-proto**. Those are the same project: hickory-client
//! depends on hickory-proto and decodes with the same codec that encoded the bytes. So the
//! existing suite proves the wire format is self-consistent, not that it is correct — the
//! same circularity that kept `rss` at Experimental until `feed-rs` did its parsing, and that
//! keeps `websocket` and `webrtc_signaling` there now. `tests/server/dns/CLAUDE.md` listed
//! "same library family as server-side hickory-proto" as an *advantage*.
//!
//! `dig` is ISC BIND's resolver. It shares no line of code with hickory, and it is the
//! program that decides whether a real operator believes a nameserver works. It is also
//! stricter than the round-trip: it checks that the transaction id it chose comes back, that
//! the question section matches the question it asked, and it reports the RCODE, so a
//! response any of those three would make a resolver discard fails here and passes there.
//!
//! ## No skip-when-missing
//!
//! If `dig` is absent this test **fails**, following `tests/server/npm/e2e_test.rs`. A test
//! that prints `SKIP` and returns `Ok(())` is a silent pass on any runner without the binary,
//! which is exactly how `kubernetes`, `oci_registry`, `maven` and `websocket` ended up with
//! maturity ratings resting on nothing. `dig` ships in the macOS base system and in the
//! `bind9-dnsutils` package present on the GitHub Ubuntu runner images.

/// Run `dig` against a NetGet DNS server on loopback and return its stdout.
///
/// `+tries=1` and `+time=5` keep exactly one query on the wire per call, so `expect_calls(1)`
/// in the mocks means what it says — dig retries by default, and each retry is another
/// `dns_query` event and another mock call.
///
/// `+noedns` for the same reason, and it is honest rather than convenient: this server does
/// not implement EDNS0 (`src/server/dns/CLAUDE.md` says so — the OPT record in a query is
/// ignored and none is added to responses). A dig that offers EDNS and gets a reply with no
/// OPT record may fall back and re-query, which would be a second `dns_query`. Newer dig
/// versions also send an EDNS COOKIE by default; `+nocookie` is *not* used to suppress it
/// because DiG 9.10, which ships with macOS, rejects that option outright — `+noedns` covers
/// it on every version.
/// **`tokio::process::Command`, never `std::process::Command`** — and this cost a debugging
/// pass, so it is worth stating why. `std::process::Command::output()` blocks the calling
/// thread until the child exits. Each `#[tokio::test]` runs on a current-thread runtime, and
/// the **mock Ollama server is in-process on that same runtime**. So a blocking `dig` parks
/// the very runtime that has to answer the `dns_query` event: dig's datagram arrived, NetGet
/// asked the model, the model could not reply because its executor was blocked waiting for
/// dig, and dig timed out after 5s having received nothing. The symptom was
/// `;; connection timed out; no servers could be reached` against a server that was up and
/// listening — indistinguishable from a broken server, and it is neither. The harness's own
/// stderr pump was blocked too, which is why the log showed five seconds of silence rather
/// than the query arriving.
