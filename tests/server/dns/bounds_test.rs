//! Every bound the DNS server declares, driven from a UDP socket where it is reachable
//! from one and from the executor where it is not.
//!
//! "A bound nobody tested is a comment." DNS declares no `max_inbound_bytes` — it is one of
//! the "fixed-size read" entries in `tests/max_inbound_bytes_declaration_test.rs`, on the
//! reason "single recv_from into a fixed 4096-byte buffer; no TCP path exists" — so the
//! receive buffer *is* the bound and it is the first thing tested here. The rest are the
//! range checks the action executor states in its own error messages: the 16-bit transaction
//! id, the 16-bit MX preference, the 12-byte floor on a hand-assembled message, and the
//! 255-octet DNS character-string.
//!
//! # What the receive-buffer test proves, and how it was checked
//!
//! A `recv_from` into a 4096-byte buffer silently discards whatever does not fit, so the
//! bound is not a refusal — it is a truncation, after which the bytes do not parse as DNS
//! and the datagram is dropped. That is a weaker property than CoAP's 4.13 and it is stated
//! rather than dressed up: what it guarantees is that **no allocation and no prompt scales
//! with what the peer sent**, which is the property `max_inbound_bytes` exists for.
//!
//! The pair is what makes it mean anything: a legal query is answered in the same test, so a
//! server that dropped everything would fail rather than pass.
