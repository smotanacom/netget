//! What a DNS client gets when the LLM backend fails.
//!
//! The failure is forced by configuring a mock for the *startup* instruction only. The
//! `dns_query` event then matches no rule, the mock Ollama server answers HTTP 500, and
//! `call_llm` returns `Err` - the same shape as a real backend outage, an overload, or a
//! malformed model response.
//!
//! Before this path existed the server wrote nothing at all, and the client sat in `recvfrom`
//! until its own timeout (5s per server in glibc's resolver) with no way to tell an outage from
//! a black hole. The assertion below is at the protocol level: RCODE 2 (SERVFAIL), the
//! transaction ID echoed, and the question section repeated - all three are required or a real
//! stub resolver discards the packet and we are back to silence.

/// The other two ways a model answer can produce no packet, which must not look alike.
///
/// `call_llm` returning `Err` — the case above — was the only fail-closed path this server
/// had. But it returns **`Ok`** whenever the model produced a syntactically valid answer that
/// this protocol could not turn into bytes:
///
/// * an answer made only of *common* actions (`show_message` is the one a model reaches for
///   when it is explaining itself), which never enter `protocol_results` at all;
/// * a DNS action `execute_action` refused — an invalid IP, an out-of-range `query_id`, a TXT
///   string over 255 octets — which is recorded as a failure and produces no output.
///
/// In both cases the old loop iterated an empty (or output-less) result set and simply ended,
/// having written nothing: the client waited out its own timeout, while
/// `src/server/dns/CLAUDE.md` claimed in as many words that "backend down, overloaded, or
/// returned nothing usable" all answered SERVFAIL. Only the first two did.
///
/// The test drives both halves against **one** server, because the assertion is that they are
/// *different*: `show_message` must be SERVFAIL and `ignore_query` must be silence. A fix that
/// answered SERVFAIL to everything would pass the first half and fail the second, which is the
/// point — `ignore_query` is a decision the model is entitled to make, and a DNS black hole is
/// a thing people build on purpose.
///
/// **Verified by removal.** Reverting the `wrote_answer` / `model_chose_silence` bookkeeping in
/// `src/server/dns/mod.rs` to the bare `for` loop makes the `show_message` query time out at
/// the 20-second deadline below; the test returns `Err` there, so the black-hole half is never
/// reached and the harness's own drop check reports rule #2 with 0 of 1 calls.
