//! The DNS server, driven by `kdig` — a second resolver, from a different project than `dig`.
//!
//! # Why a second one
//!
//! `dig_test.rs` already breaks the circularity that `test.rs` has: the server encodes with
//! hickory-proto and `test.rs` decodes with hickory-client, so that suite proves the wire format
//! is self-consistent rather than correct. ISC's `dig` shares no code with hickory and fixed it.
//!
//! One client is still one client, and this session has twice shown what the second one finds.
//! `etcd` and `grpc` were each Beta on a single lenient peer, and in both cases **no conformant
//! implementation could complete a successful call** while every existing test passed. The
//! project CLAUDE.md's bar for `Stable` asks for two independent third-party clients for exactly
//! that reason, and `dns` is one of the few protocols close enough for the second to be cheap.
//!
//! `kdig` is Knot DNS's resolver — CZ.NIC, not ISC, and a separate implementation of the same
//! RFCs. Two resolvers that agree with each other and with us is the strongest evidence short of
//! the spec; two that disagree is a finding.
//!
//! # What it checks that a round-trip cannot
//!
//! Like dig, kdig picks the transaction id and discards a reply that does not carry it back,
//! confirms the question section, and reports the RCODE. Unlike dig it renders through its own
//! presentation writer, so the rdata assertions here are a second independent reading of the
//! same bytes.
