//! E2E tests for the USB HID keyboard server.
//!
//! The question these answer: *the model says "type hello" — do the bytes a host reads off the
//! interrupt endpoint spell hello?*
//!
//! They drive a real USB/IP client over TCP (`tests/helpers/usbip_client.rs`): `OP_REQ_IMPORT`,
//! then interrupt transfers on endpoint 1. At the USB/IP layer an interrupt transfer is
//! indistinguishable from a bulk one — both are `USBIP_CMD_SUBMIT` carrying an endpoint
//! *number* — so `bulk_in`/`bulk_out` drive the HID endpoints. HID reports are decoded here
//! against the boot-protocol layout rather than against netget's encoder.
//!
//! **What this does not prove.** There is no `vhci-hcd`, no `/dev/input/eventX`, no `evtest` —
//! macOS has no USB/IP client. A passing run means netget emits the right HID reports for the
//! model's actions; it does not mean Linux turns them into key events.
//!
//! ## What this file replaced
//!
//! Six tests that opened a bare `TcpStream` to the USB/IP port and asserted only that a mock
//! rule fired. They could not observe a single HID report, so `type_text`, `press_key_combo` and
//! `release_all_keys` were "tested" without anything checking what went on the wire. Two were
//! `#[ignore]`d with accurate product-gap notes:
//!
//! - `usb_keyboard_led_status` was declared and never emitted, because the crate's
//!   `UsbHidKeyboardHandler` discards HID output reports. `handler.rs` now intercepts
//!   `SET_REPORT` and the event has a real emit site — so that test is live, and drives a real
//!   LED write.
//! - `usb_keyboard_detached` was noted as unreachable behind `sleep(u64::MAX)`. That was fixed
//!   in the source before this pass; the `#[ignore]` was simply stale.
