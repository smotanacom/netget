//! A TCP handshake is not an attachment, and must cost nothing.
//!
//! # The defect
//!
//! Every USB server used to make its `*_attached` LLM call the moment `accept()` returned —
//! before the peer had sent a byte. USB/IP authenticates nothing (`OP_REQ_IMPORT` carries a bus
//! id and no credential), so `nc <host> <port>` bought a model round-trip from a three-packet
//! TCP handshake, and closing the socket bought a second one for `*_detached`. Anything that
//! scans a port — a health check, a monitoring probe, `nmap` — spent the operator's model
//! budget without ever speaking the protocol.
//!
//! The screen in `src/server/usb/guard.rs` already reads and classifies every inbound message,
//! so it is the one place that knows when a peer has actually asked to import a device. It
//! fires a `oneshot` on the first admitted `OP_REQ_IMPORT` and the attach event hangs off that.
//! `OP_REQ_DEVLIST` deliberately does not fire it: listing what a host exports is not attaching
//! to it, and it is exactly the enumeration a scanner would do.
//!
//! # Why the test is shaped like this
//!
//! Proving a *negative* about an asynchronous system needs a control, or a zero is
//! indistinguishable from a mock nobody reached. So the same test does both halves against one
//! server: three bare connects that say nothing, then one real import, then the count. The
//! import is the control — it proves the attach path is alive and reachable, which is what
//! makes the preceding zero mean something. Before the fix the total would be 7 rather than 2
//! (startup + three attaches + three detaches + the import's attach); after it, exactly 2.
//!
//! The import also orders the measurement: the bare connects were made *first*, so any call
//! they were going to provoke had its chance before the import's did. The short settle
//! afterwards is a backstop against a call still in flight, not the assertion's only defence.
