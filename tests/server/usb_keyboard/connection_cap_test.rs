//! A USB server admits a bounded number of connections, and says so in the log.
//!
//! # Why the USB family needed this separately
//!
//! `src/server/accept_bounded.rs` landed with 37 adopters and none of them was a USB server, so
//! all six accepted without limit. A USB/IP connection is not a request: each one costs a
//! `usbip::UsbIpServer`, a live `UsbInterfaceHandler` with its own session state, an `AppState`
//! connection entry and up to `MAX_TRANSFER_BUFFER_BYTES` in flight — and none of that is behind
//! any authentication, because USB/IP has none. So the per-connection bounds the screen already
//! applies were "bounded per connection" rather than "bounded", exactly as that module's own
//! docs describe.
//!
//! # What the refusal looks like, and why it is silence
//!
//! USB/IP has no "busy" message. Its only server-to-client messages are `OP_REP_DEVLIST`,
//! `OP_REP_IMPORT` and the URB replies, each a positive assertion about a device, and a peer
//! that has only completed a TCP handshake has asked no question to answer. So the refusal is a
//! plain close — `accept_bounded`'s empty-slice arm — and the reason lives in the log under the
//! `decision=fail_closed_connection_cap` tag this project greps for.
//!
//! # The three things asserted, because one of them alone would be satisfied by a bug
//!
//! 1. The connection past the cap is **closed**, promptly.
//! 2. The server is **still serving** — a cap that killed the listener or the process would
//!    satisfy (1) perfectly.
//! 3. Releasing one admitted connection **frees exactly one slot**. A permit dropped early
//!    un-caps the server silently; a permit never released wedges it shut after `MAX` peers have
//!    ever connected, which is far worse than no cap at all.
