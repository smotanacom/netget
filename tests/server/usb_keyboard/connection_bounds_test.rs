//! The read deadlines on a real, running USB keyboard server, driven from a raw socket.
//!
//! The mechanics and the full argument are in `tests/helpers/usbip_bounds.rs`, because all six
//! USB servers hand their socket to the same screen (`src/server/usb/guard.rs`) and there is
//! exactly one place in the process that reads from it. This file supplies what is specific to
//! USB keyboard: its registry name, and the sentence below.
//!
//! A host with a HID keyboard bound polls the interrupt endpoint every 10ms, so it looks busy
//! whatever the idle bound is. That is a property of the host's driver, not of USB/IP, and it is
//! why the number is argued against the protocol rather than against this device.
//!
//! Run with:
//!   ./cargo-isolated.sh test --no-default-features --features usb-keyboard --test server -- \
//!       usb_keyboard::connection_bounds --test-threads=100
