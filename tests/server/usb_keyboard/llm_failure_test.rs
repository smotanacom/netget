//! What a HID host gets when the LLM backend fails: nothing, on purpose.
//!
//! The failure is forced by configuring a mock for the *startup* instruction only. The
//! `usb_keyboard_attached` event then matches no rule, the mock Ollama server answers HTTP 500,
//! and `call_llm` returns `Err` — the same shape as a real backend outage.
//!
//! ## Why silence is the right answer here, unlike everywhere else in this sweep
//!
//! Most protocols owe the peer a reply, and going quiet on an LLM failure leaves it hanging
//! until its own timeout. A HID keyboard owes nothing: the host polls the interrupt IN endpoint
//! and is NAKed whenever no key is down, which is the state of every keyboard in the world most
//! of the time. There is no HID vocabulary for "the device's brain is unreachable" — STALLing
//! the endpoint is a *fault* that makes a host reset or unbind the device, which is both less
//! truthful and worse than reporting no keystrokes. (`usbip` cannot express it either: an `Err`
//! from `handle_urb` aborts the USB/IP session for the whole device.)
//!
//! So the two things that must hold are the ones asserted below:
//!
//! 1. **Nothing is typed.** A failed LLM call must never put a keystroke on the wire. This is
//!    the fail-closed property that matters for a keyboard — a device that types *something*
//!    when its brain is unreachable would be far worse than one that types nothing.
//! 2. **The failure is recorded at ERROR, on both channels, tagged `decision=llm_error`.** Silence that goes unlogged is
//!    indistinguishable from a working keyboard nobody is using, which is exactly the situation
//!    an operator needs to be able to tell apart.
//!
//! The device must also still be *there*: the session survives, so a host that keeps polling
//! gets a working keyboard back the moment the backend recovers.
