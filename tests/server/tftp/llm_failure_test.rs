//! What a TFTP client gets when the LLM backend fails.
//!
//! The failure is forced the same way `tests/server/dns/llm_failure_test.rs` does it: the
//! mock is configured for the *startup* instruction (and, where the test needs to get
//! mid-transfer, for the first network event only). Every later event matches no rule, the
//! mock Ollama server answers HTTP 500, and `call_llm` returns `Err` - the same shape as a
//! real backend outage, an overload, or a malformed model response.
//!
//! Two of TFTP's four LLM call sites used to write nothing at all on that path:
//! `continue_read_transfer` (the client has ACKed block N and is waiting for block N+1) and
//! `receive_write_data` (the client has sent a DATA block and is waiting for its ACK). A
//! transfer that simply stops mid-stream is worse than one that fails - for a PXE boot it
//! looks like a corrupt image. All four now answer with opcode 5 (ERROR) and end the
//! transfer.
//!
//! The assertions are at the protocol level: real bytes off a real UDP socket, checked for
//! opcode 5, an error code, and a NUL-terminated message, because that is all a client
//! parses.
