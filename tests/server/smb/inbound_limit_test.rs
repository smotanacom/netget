//! SMB's inbound bounds — `MAX_MESSAGE_BYTES`, the declared `max_inbound_bytes`, and
//! `MAX_WRITE_SIZE`, the negotiated `MaxWriteSize` — driven from the wire.
//!
//! Every SMB2 message arrives behind a Direct TCP transport header that announces its length
//! (MS-SMB2 2.1), so the frame length is the one number that decides what the server
//! allocates. Two bounds follow from it, and each is tested at the bound and one past it,
//! after a NEGOTIATE, a SESSION_SETUP the model approves, a TREE_CONNECT and a CREATE:
//!
//! 1. **`NEGOTIATE` advertises `MAX_WRITE_SIZE`** as `MaxWriteSize`, so a client never sends
//!    more.
//! 2. **A WRITE of exactly `MAX_WRITE_SIZE` bytes** is read and handed to the model.
//! 3. **A WRITE of `MAX_WRITE_SIZE + 1` bytes** — a whole, well-framed message — is answered
//!    `STATUS_INVALID_PARAMETER` (MS-SMB2 3.3.5.13) with zero model calls, and because the
//!    frame was read whole the connection stays in step: an ECHO after it is answered.
//! 4. **A frame announcing `MAX_MESSAGE_BYTES + 1`** is refused after its 64-byte SMB2 header
//!    alone — `STATUS_INVALID_PARAMETER` to that request's MessageId — and the connection
//!    closes, because the rest of the frame is unread. Zero model calls.
//! 5. **The server still serves**: a fresh connection's SESSION_SETUP reaches the model.
//!
//! **Verified by removal.** With the `length > MAX_WRITE_SIZE` check removed, assertion 3
//! fails: the over-size WRITE reaches the model. With the `len > MAX_MESSAGE_BYTES` check
//! removed, assertion 4 fails: the server allocates the announced frame and waits for bytes
//! that never come, so no reply arrives.
//!
//! Run with:
//!   ./cargo-isolated.sh test --no-default-features --features smb --test server -- smb::inbound_limit --test-threads=100
