//! Two clients that are not `reqwest`: the real `curl` binary and Python's `http.client`.
//!
//! # Why
//!
//! `http` is the most-used protocol here and its Beta rating rested on **reqwest** alone —
//! hyper, in-process, in the same runtime, written by the same ecosystem as the server. One
//! client can agree with one bug, and this session found three protocols where it was doing
//! exactly that (`etcd`, `grpc` and `mysql`, each unusable by any conformant client while every
//! test passed).
//!
//! Two are added at once because they are cheap and because they fail differently:
//!
//! * **curl** is libcurl, C, and the program an operator reaches for. It parses the status line
//!   and headers itself and will complain about a malformed framing that hyper tolerates.
//! * **Python's `http.client`** is a third, unrelated implementation in the standard library, so
//!   it needs no install anywhere. It exposes the reason phrase and the raw header list, which
//!   is where a hand-built response most often differs from a generated one.
//!
//! # What this deliberately does not claim
//!
//! The project CLAUDE.md is blunt that a generic HTTP client "proves an HTTP server answers, not
//! that the protocol on top is right" — that rule is about protocols *layered over* HTTP, like
//! `couchdb` or `openapi`. Here HTTP **is** the protocol, so an independent HTTP implementation
//! is exactly the right peer, and these two are as independent as it gets.
