//! What an HTTP client gets when netget cannot, or will not, answer.
//!
//! `CLAUDE.md` names HTTP as the reference implementation for answering a peer on LLM
//! failure ("copy `http` (503 + `Retry-After` vs 500)"), so ~44 other protocols were
//! written by looking at it. Nothing tested it. These two tests pin the parts other
//! protocols are told to copy:
//!
//! - a backend failure produces a real status code, promptly, instead of leaving the
//!   client to hang until its own timeout, and
//! - the response body carries a *category*, never the error text. Backend URLs, model
//!   names, file paths and `anyhow` context chains reached the wire in ~25 protocols at
//!   once because each copied its neighbour; the assertion below is what stops that
//!   coming back here.
//!
//! The third test covers the request-body bound. An HTTP body is buffered whole and then
//! embedded in an LLM prompt, so an unbounded one is a memory exhaustion with no upside;
//! over the cap the server answers 413 and spends no LLM call at all.
