//! Every HTTP request ends in exactly one `decision=` line, and the three ways a request
//! can end badly are told apart there.
//!
//! HTTP is the protocol whose failure handling root `CLAUDE.md` tells everything else to
//! copy, so its own log has to carry the distinction it teaches. Before these tests:
//!
//! - a model that answered `send_http_response`,
//! - a model that answered with nothing at all, and
//! - a model whose action the executor refused
//!
//! all produced the same single line (`→ HTTP GET / → 200 (0 bytes)`) and, in the last two
//! cases, the same affirmative `200` on the wire. Only a backend *failure* was tagged, and
//! that tag is emitted from `src/server/http_common/handler.rs`, which is shared with
//! ipp/openapi/… — so the success/silence split had to be added at HTTP's own call site.
//!
//! **The second test pins a fail-open.** A model that says nothing still answers the peer
//! `200 OK`. That is not repaired here — repairing it would change HTTP's wire behaviour for
//! every existing prompt and handler — but it is now stated in the log, in the words
//! `decision=model_silent fallback=blank_200`, so an operator can find every request that
//! was "answered" by nobody.
