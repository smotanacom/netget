//! `LineCoding::from_bytes` is total: a short payload returns `None`, it does not panic.
//!
//! It is `pub`, it takes an arbitrary `&[u8]`, and it used to index `bytes[0..6]` with no
//! length check — relying entirely on its single call site in `usb/serial/handler.rs` guarding
//! with `req.len() >= 7`. The payload is a SET_LINE_CODING body, so its length is chosen by the
//! USB host rather than by us; the defect was latent, one new caller away.
//!
//! It is also the kind of panic that hides. `handle_urb` runs inside a `tokio::spawn`ed
//! connection task, and a panic there is swallowed by the task: the server stays `Running`, the
//! log shows the control transfer succeeding, and the peer hangs. (`src/panic_log.rs` now
//! writes such a panic to `netget.log`, which makes it findable rather than silent — but
//! findable is not fixed.)
//!
//! Both directions are asserted: every short length refuses, and a well-formed payload still
//! decodes exactly, little-endian baud rate included. A guard that returned `None` for
//! everything would satisfy the first half alone.
//!
//! Run with:
//!   ./cargo-isolated.sh test --no-default-features --features usb-serial \
//!       --test server -- usb_serial::line_coding --test-threads=100
