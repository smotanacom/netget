//! What a serial host gets when the LLM backend fails.
//!
//! The failure is forced by configuring a mock for the *startup* instruction only. Every event
//! the protocol raises then matches no rule, the mock Ollama server answers HTTP 500, and
//! `call_llm` returns `Err` — the same shape as a real backend outage.
//!
//! A serial port has no request/response framing, so there is no reply to fail with an error
//! code the way DNS fails with SERVFAIL. It does have a notification channel: CDC PSTN 1.2
//! §6.5.4's `SERIAL_STATE`, sent on the interrupt IN endpoint, whose `bOverRun` bit means
//! *"received data has been discarded due to overrun in the device"*. That is precisely what
//! happened — the host wrote, nobody could answer, the bytes are gone — so that is what the port
//! now says. A Linux `cdc-acm` host counts it as a receive overrun on the tty.
//!
//! Silence is the alternative and it is the wrong one here: a port that says nothing is
//! indistinguishable from a port with nothing to say, so an outage would look exactly like a
//! quiet peer.
//!
//! Only `usb_serial_data_received` earns a notification. `attached` has had nothing written to
//! it yet and by `detached` the port is gone; both log and stop.
//!
//! ## Wire detail worth knowing
//!
//! The notification is 10 bytes and the interrupt endpoint's `wMaxPacketSize` is **8** (from the
//! `usbip` crate's CDC endpoint table). So it crosses as two packets, 8 then 2, and the host
//! reassembles — which is what a real host does and what this test does below. A single URB
//! returning all 10 bytes would be a protocol violation, not a convenience.
