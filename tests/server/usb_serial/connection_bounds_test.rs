//! The read deadlines on a real, running USB serial server, driven from a raw socket.
//!
//! The mechanics and the full argument are in `tests/helpers/usbip_bounds.rs`, because all six
//! USB servers hand their socket to the same screen (`src/server/usb/guard.rs`) and there is
//! exactly one place in the process that reads from it. This file supplies what is specific to
//! USB serial: its registry name, and the sentence below.
//!
//! A CDC ACM host keeps a bulk IN URB outstanding and NetGet answers it immediately out of the
//! transmit queue, so the host's silence is the host's choice; nothing here is waiting on the
//! model when the idle bound is armed.
//!
//! Run with:
//!   ./cargo-isolated.sh test --no-default-features --features usb-serial --test server -- \
//!       usb_serial::connection_bounds --test-threads=100
