//! The connection cap on a real, running Finger server, driven from the wire.
//!
//! `QUERY_READ_TIMEOUT` bounds how long *one* connected-but-silent peer holds a socket, a task
//! and an `AppState` row. It does nothing about how many such peers there can be at once, and
//! until September 2026 there was no answer to that at all: this accept loop admitted every
//! connection offered to it, pre-query, so `timeout × arrival rate` sockets were free to anyone
//! who could open them.
//!
//! Three claims, and the third is the one that catches the subtle bug:
//!
//! 1. `MAX_CONNECTIONS` peers are admitted.
//! 2. The next one is refused **in finger's own vocabulary** — a free-text line, which is all a
//!    finger reply ever is (RFC 1288 §2.3) — and then closed, rather than dropped in silence.
//! 3. Closing an admitted connection **frees exactly one slot**. A permit dropped before the
//!    connection really ends un-caps the server silently; a permit never released wedges it shut
//!    once `MAX_CONNECTIONS` peers have ever connected, which is worse than having no cap.
//!
//! **How this was proved to fail without the cap**: replace the `accept_bounded` call in
//! `src/server/finger/mod.rs` with a bare `listener.accept().await` (and drop the permit from
//! the connection task). The second test then reads nothing from the over-cap peer and fails on
//! the refusal assertion — the peer was admitted.
//!
//! The server is model-free: an empty instruction really is model-free, where `None` is replaced
//! by a default one and every event would consult the LLM. Finger is client-speaks-first, so a
//! peer that connects and stays quiet provokes no model call at all. Loopback only.
//!
//! Run with:
//!   ./cargo-isolated.sh test --no-default-features --features finger --test server -- finger::connection_bounds --test-threads=100
