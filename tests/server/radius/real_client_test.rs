//! RADIUS against a real, independent client: FreeRADIUS `radclient`.
//!
//! Everything else in this directory is NetGet checking NetGet, or NetGet checking itself
//! against byte literals. This file is the only place a peer written by someone else decides
//! whether our packets are acceptable — and `radclient` is strict about the one thing that
//! matters most:
//!
//! ```text
//! Reply verification failed: Received Access-Accept packet from home server ...
//! with invalid Response Authenticator!  (Shared secret is incorrect.)
//! ```
//!
//! That was confirmed by hand against a deliberately-wrong authenticator before this test was
//! written, so a green run here really does mean the MD5 is right.
//!
//! **This test FAILS, it does not skip, when `radclient` is absent.** That is deliberate and
//! it is the whole reason RADIUS may be rated `Beta`. A skip-when-missing gate returns
//! `Ok(())` on a runner without FreeRADIUS, so the suite reports a silent pass and the
//! maturity rating ends up resting on nothing — which is exactly how a claim outlives the
//! evidence that justified it. `tests/server/npm/e2e_test.rs` is the precedent.
//!
//! Install with `brew install freeradius-server` (macOS) or `apt-get install -y freeradius-utils`
//! (Debian/Ubuntu). RADIUS is not in CI's `CI_FEATURES`, so this costs the CI gate nothing;
//! see `tests/server/radius/CLAUDE.md`.
