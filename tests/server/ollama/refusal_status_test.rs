//! A model-supplied `status_code` on `ollama_error_response` narrowed with `as u16`
//! delivered the refusal as a success.
//!
//! `model_error_response` reads the model's raw action and did
//! `StatusCode::from_u16(code as u16)`. `65736 as u16` is `200`, `from_u16(200)` succeeds,
//! and the client received HTTP 200 with a body that happens to carry an `error` key — which
//! every Ollama client reads as an answered request. The function's own doc comment says the
//! one distinction that has to survive is "a refusal and an outage must not be diagnosed as
//! each other"; arithmetic was quietly erasing a third one, refusal versus success.
//!
//! A 2xx is rejected even when written literally, for the same reason: this path only ever
//! builds refusals. An unusable value falls back to 400 rather than failing the request, so
//! the refusal itself always survives.
