//! E2E tests for the WebRTC Signaling server
//!
//! This is a WebSocket SDP relay: a peer sends `register` with a peer id, then `offer`,
//! `answer`, `ice_candidate` or `relay` frames addressed `to` another peer, and the server
//! forwards them. Relaying needs no LLM call; the model is consulted only on connect/disconnect.
//!
//! The previous suite could not fail. Every test started a server, slept, printed a ✅ and
//! returned — **no peer ever connected** — and none called `verify_mocks()`, so the
//! `expect_calls(1)` on the peer-connected rules asserted nothing at all. Its own CLAUDE.md said
//! so outright: "No Real WebSocket Connections: Tests use mocks, don't establish actual
//! WebSocket connections."
//!
//! It also mocked four actions that do not exist — `broadcast_message`, `list_signaling_peers`,
//! `wait_for_more`, `announcement` — which the server would have rejected as unknown; the
//! mock-action-name guard is what finally surfaced that. And `"port": "{AVAILABLE_PORT}"` was a
//! string where a number is required, so `open_server` was rejected as malformed and nothing
//! started.
//!
//! These connect real WebSocket peers and assert on the frames that come back. This protocol has
//! exactly two actions, `send_signaling_message` and `disconnect_peer`, and nothing else is
//! mocked here.
