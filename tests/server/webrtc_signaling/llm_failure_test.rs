//! What a signaling peer gets when the LLM backend fails.
//!
//! The failure is forced the way `tests/server/dns/llm_failure_test.rs` forces it: a mock is
//! configured for the *startup* instruction only, so every signaling event matches no rule,
//! the mock Ollama server answers HTTP 500, and `call_llm` returns `Err`.
//!
//! All three call sites used to swallow that with `if let Ok(..)` / `let _ =`. Only one of the
//! three can honestly answer the peer, and the difference is the point of this file:
//!
//! - **`webrtc_signaling_peer_connected`** is the one event carrying actions the model can act
//!   on (`send_signaling_message`, `disconnect_peer`), so a peer may be waiting on what the
//!   model decides. It now gets `{"type": "error", ...}` — the protocol's own vocabulary, and
//!   a message this protocol already sends for duplicate ids and undeliverable targets.
//! - **`webrtc_signaling_message_received`** fires *after* the relay has already happened and
//!   is declared `.with_no_actions()`, so the model cannot speak to the peer even when it
//!   succeeds. Silence is the only correct answer, and an error frame here would announce a
//!   failure the peer's signaling did not suffer. The test asserts that silence, and that the
//!   relay itself is untouched.
//! - **`webrtc_signaling_peer_disconnected`** fires because the socket has already gone. There
//!   is nobody to answer.
//!
//! Nothing here may be answered with a *successful-looking* frame: an `error` is the only
//! thing the server may invent on the model's behalf.
