//! What a MySQL client gets when the LLM backend fails: an ERR packet with a SQLSTATE.
//!
//! MySQL's ERR packet carries an error number *and* the SQLSTATE that goes with it, which is
//! what lets a driver classify a failure instead of guessing from the message text. The
//! assertion below is on both, read back through `mysql_async` - an independent client
//! implementation of the wire protocol, so decoding it is evidence rather than a tautology.
//!
//! The alternative this replaced was an empty OK packet, which the client cannot distinguish
//! from a statement that succeeded and affected no rows.
