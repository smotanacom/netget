//! A MySQL packet larger than `max_allowed_packet` is refused, in MySQL's own vocabulary.
//!
//! # What was wrong
//!
//! `opensrv-mysql` 0.7.0 has no maximum-packet check anywhere. Its `packet()` parser assembles
//! a logical packet with `nom::multi::fold_many0(fullpacket, …)` — an unbounded fold over
//! 16 MiB continuation fragments — and `PacketReader::next_async` doubles its buffer until a
//! whole logical packet fits. The peer therefore decided how much this process allocated, and
//! it decided **before authentication and before any model call**: the first thing a MySQL
//! client ever sends is its handshake response, read through exactly this path.
//!
//! The server also *published* a ceiling it never applied — `opensrv-mysql` answers
//! `SELECT @@max_allowed_packet` with 67108864 itself, without consulting NetGet's shim.
//!
//! # What these tests assert
//!
//! Three things, and the third is what stops the first two from being satisfiable by a guard
//! that refuses everything:
//!
//! 1. A logical packet one byte past `MAX_PACKET_BYTES` is refused with **1153
//!    `ER_NET_PACKET_TOO_LARGE`, SQLSTATE `08S01`**, at the correct sequence id, **during the
//!    handshake** — so the bound is demonstrably pre-authentication — and with **zero** model
//!    calls.
//! 2. A logical packet of exactly `MAX_PACKET_BYTES` is accepted by the framing, and so is a
//!    legitimate multi-fragment chain. Both are asserted against the reader directly, because
//!    asserting them on the wire would mean moving 64 MiB per case for no extra evidence.
//! 3. An ordinary query still works and still reaches the model exactly once.
//!
//! # Why the wire test uses a raw socket
//!
//! `mysql_async` would be the natural client and is the wrong tool here. The refusal has to
//! survive the peer still writing, and a client that polls its read side while writing can
//! parse the answer before the close lands — which hides exactly the `RST`-discards-the-reply
//! failure the lingering drain in `src/server/mysql/mod.rs` exists to prevent. A raw socket
//! that writes and then reads is the honest peer to test against. (The same difference was
//! measured on `ipp`: 5 failures in 8 runs with a raw socket, 5 in 5 with a hyper client.)
