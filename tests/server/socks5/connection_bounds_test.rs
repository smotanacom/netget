//! The connection cap and the relay idle bound on a real, running SOCKS5 proxy, driven from the
//! wire. The idle tests are described where they start, below the cap test.
//!
//! `HANDSHAKE_TIMEOUT_SECS` is 30 seconds and it bounds *one* peer: a stranger who connects and
//! says nothing holds a socket, a task and an `AppState` row for half a minute, and nothing
//! bounded how many such strangers there could be at once. A proxy is the worst case for that
//! in this tree, because an *established* connection holds two sockets — the client's and the
//! one this server opened to the target on its behalf — so an uncapped accept loop lets a
//! stranger spend this process's descriptors two at a time.
//!
//! Three claims:
//!
//! 1. `MAX_CONNECTIONS` peers are admitted.
//! 2. The next one is refused with `05 FF` — RFC 1928 §3's method-selection reply carrying
//!    `NO ACCEPTABLE METHODS` — and then closed. That message is the only thing a SOCKS5 server
//!    may send without having read anything: it echoes nothing from the greeting, so unlike a
//!    reply carrying a request id it cannot be mis-matched against something the peer never
//!    sent, and §3 requires the client to close on `X'FF'`.
//! 3. Closing an admitted connection **frees exactly one slot**. A permit dropped before the
//!    connection ends un-caps the server silently; one never released wedges it shut after
//!    `MAX_CONNECTIONS` peers have ever connected.
//!
//! **How this was proved to fail without the cap**: replace the `accept_bounded` call in
//! `src/server/socks5/mod.rs` with a bare `listener.accept().await` (and drop the permit from
//! the connection task). The over-cap peer is then admitted, so it sends nothing and waits for
//! *our* greeting, and the test fails on the `05 FF` read timing out.
//!
//! The server is model-free: an empty instruction really is model-free, where `None` is
//! replaced by a default one. SOCKS5 is client-speaks-first, so a peer that says nothing
//! provokes no model call. Loopback only.
//!
//! Run with:
//!   ./cargo-isolated.sh test --no-default-features --features socks5 --test server -- socks5::connection_bounds --test-threads=100
