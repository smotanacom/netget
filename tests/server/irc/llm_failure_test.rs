//! What an IRC client gets when the LLM backend fails: numeric 400, then a closed link.
//!
//! IRC has no per-command acknowledgement, so silence is not merely a delay: a client that has
//! sent NICK/USER waits for numeric 001 and has no timeout short of its own connection
//! timeout. Numeric 400 (`ERR_UNKNOWNERROR`) is the code reserved for an error with no more
//! specific numeric, and it carries the offending command as a parameter.
//!
//! It is deliberately not 421 (`ERR_UNKNOWNCOMMAND`), which would tell the client the command
//! does not exist, and it is deliberately not any registration numeric - a client cannot
//! mistake 400 for a completed registration. A non-transient failure is followed by `ERROR`
//! and a close, which is IRC's own way of saying "this link is over, here is why" and is what
//! unblocks a client mid-registration.
