//! The two read deadlines on a real, running WHOIS server, driven from the wire.
//!
//! WHOIS is client-speaks-first: the server says nothing until a line arrives, so a peer that
//! connects and stays quiet holds a socket, a task and an `AppState` row while having begun no
//! session at all. That is what `FIRST_QUERY_READ_TIMEOUT` exists for.
//!
//! **The default is 300 seconds and these tests do not wait it out.** The peer this server most
//! often has is NetGet's own WHOIS client, which opens the socket and sends *nothing* until the
//! model or a person supplies a query — the dashboard's `[ + whois client ]` answers the connect
//! event with nothing and then waits for someone to type into `[ send message ]`. The bound was
//! 30 seconds, which is less than a person takes, so the server dropped the operator's own
//! client while they were still looking at it. Both bounds are therefore declared startup
//! parameters (`first_byte_timeout_secs`, `idle_timeout_secs`) and these tests set them small;
//! what is asserted is that each deadline is applied to the read it names and to nothing else.
//!
//! Three properties, and each alone would be satisfied by a bug:
//!
//! 1. A peer that connects and **says nothing** is closed at `first_byte_timeout_secs`.
//! 2. The two bounds are **separate numbers**: a peer that has been answered is closed at
//!    `idle_timeout_secs` instead, so setting one does not silently set the other.
//! 3. A query **parked for a human** is never closed by either deadline — the clock wraps the
//!    `read()` and not the answer, which is the whole point of a `manual` rule having a
//!    300-second window of its own.
//!
//! **How this was proved to fail without the bound**: replace the `next_query(read_timeout)`
//! deadline in `src/server/whois/mod.rs` with an unbounded read and the first test hangs for
//! its whole assertion window, then fails with "still holding the socket".
//!
//! No mock backend: the LLM endpoint is a dead port, because these tests assert on deadlines
//! rather than on answers. Loopback only.
//!
//! Run with:
//!   ./cargo-isolated.sh test --no-default-features --features whois --test server -- whois::connection_bounds --test-threads=100
