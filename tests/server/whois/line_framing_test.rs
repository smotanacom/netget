//! A WHOIS query is a *line*, not a TCP segment.
//!
//! The read loop used to raise one `whois_query` event per `read()`, so a query split across
//! two segments became two events carrying two fragments — and a peer dripping one byte at a
//! time bought one LLM call per byte from a socket nothing authenticates. Both tests here are
//! about that boundary; neither needs a model to answer the query itself.
//!
//! WHOIS is the protocol other simple protocols in this repo were told to copy, so a framing
//! defect here is the kind that gets inherited.
