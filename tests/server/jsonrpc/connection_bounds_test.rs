//! JSON-RPC's connection bounds, driven from the wire.
//!
//! `src/server/jsonrpc/mod.rs` declares three numbers and argues each beside itself:
//! `FIRST_BYTE_READ_TIMEOUT` (30s — HTTP is client-speaks-first, so a peer that has sent no byte
//! has asked nothing), `IDLE_BETWEEN_REQUESTS_TIMEOUT` (75s — five minutes' worth of application
//! think time is not needed: a long poll is a request in flight, so nginx's `keepalive_timeout`
//! covers the only thing this bound measures.) and
//! `MAX_CONNECTIONS` (256). A bound nobody tested is a comment, so these drive all three from
//! a socket.
//!
//! The mechanics, the three-socket design and the removal-verification notes are in
//! `tests/helpers/http_bounds.rs`; this file supplies only what is specific to JSON-RPC.
//!
//! Run with:
//!   ./cargo-isolated.sh test --no-default-features --features jsonrpc \
//!       --test server::jsonrpc::connection_bounds_test -- --test-threads=100
