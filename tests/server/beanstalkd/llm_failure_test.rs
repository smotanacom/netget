//! What a beanstalkd client gets when the model cannot answer: `INTERNAL_ERROR` — never
//! silence, never an internal error string, never an invented job or an invented `DELETED`.
//!
//! Four ways the model can fail to answer, all identical on the wire and distinct in the log:
//!
//! * the backend is down → `decision=fail_closed_llm_error`;
//! * the handler ran and produced nothing → `decision=model_silent`;
//! * the handler produced a reply that does not answer the command (`RESERVED` to a `delete`)
//!   → `decision=fail_closed_mismatched_reply`. NetGet renders every byte, so a wrong *shape*
//!   is the one way left for a model to put something a client would misread on the wire;
//! * the handler asked to keep the client waiting on a command that is not a reserve → the
//!   same `fail_closed_mismatched_reply`: only a worker in `reserve` may be left waiting.
//!
//! Unlike DICT's `420`, each of these is a complete beanstalkd answer to one command, so the
//! session continues and the next command is answered.
//!
//! Run with:
//!   ./cargo-isolated.sh test --no-default-features --features beanstalkd --test server -- beanstalkd::llm_failure --test-threads=100
