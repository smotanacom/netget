//! The connection cap and the idle bound on a real, running DoH server, driven from the wire.
//!
//! `TLS_HANDSHAKE_TIMEOUT` (10s) bounds how long *one* peer holds a connection before it has
//! handshaken, and after that hyper owns the HTTP/2 session. Neither bound says anything about
//! how many such peers there may be, and until September 2026 this accept loop admitted every
//! connection offered to it. DoH exists precisely so that a whole client population multiplexes
//! onto a few long-lived HTTP/2 connections, so the number of *sockets* a stranger can pin here
//! was the one thing nothing measured.
//!
//! Three claims:
//!
//! 1. `MAX_CONNECTIONS` peers are admitted — and here they are admitted *properly*, each
//!    completing a real TLS handshake. That is not decoration: a peer that merely opens a
//!    socket is evicted by `TLS_HANDSHAKE_TIMEOUT` after ten seconds, which would free slots on
//!    its own and let claim 3 below pass for a reason that has nothing to do with the permit.
//!    A handshaken connection is parked in hyper's HTTP/2 session instead, where only the idle
//!    bound evicts it — 300 seconds at the default this test runs with, far past its own
//!    length — so the cap is the only thing this test can be measuring.
//! 2. The next one is closed **with nothing written**, and that is the right answer rather than
//!    a shortcut. The three plaintext HTTP servers capped alongside this one answer 503 with
//!    `Retry-After`; here the peer is mid-`ClientHello` and feeds everything it reads to a TLS
//!    record parser, so `HTTP/1.1 503` is not a refusal but a malformed record, and the client
//!    records a TLS failure rather than backing off. Answering inside TLS would mean completing
//!    a handshake in order to refuse — a signature per refused connection — and RFC 8446 §6.2
//!    defines no alert meaning "at capacity". So the assertion is exactly "the handshake does
//!    not complete, promptly".
//! 3. Closing an admitted connection **frees exactly one slot**. A permit dropped before the
//!    connection ends un-caps the server silently; one never released wedges it shut after
//!    `MAX_CONNECTIONS` peers have ever connected.
//!
//! **How this was proved to fail without the cap**: replace the `accept_bounded` call in
//! `src/server/doh/mod.rs` with a bare `listener.accept().await` (and drop the permit from the
//! connection task). The over-cap peer's handshake then succeeds and the test fails on the
//! assertion that it must not.
//!
//! The server is model-free: an empty instruction really is model-free, where `None` is
//! replaced by a default one. No HTTP request is ever sent, so no model call is provoked.
//! Loopback only.
//!
//! The idle bound has three tests of its own, described where they start below.
//!
//! Run with:
//!   ./cargo-isolated.sh test --no-default-features --features doh --test server -- doh::connection_bounds --test-threads=100
