//! What a DoH client gets when the LLM backend fails: a SERVFAIL message in a 200, not a 5xx.
//!
//! DoH is DNS in an HTTP body, and RFC 8484 §4.2.1 makes `200 application/dns-message` the
//! status for "this HTTP transaction carried a DNS message" — whether that message is an
//! answer or a failure is DNS's business, not HTTP's.
//!
//! This server used to return `500 "LLM error"`. That is a statement about the *resolver
//! endpoint*, not about the name: real DoH clients treat a 5xx as the server being broken,
//! mark it down and fail over, which is a far heavier reaction than the transient backend
//! hiccup that caused it. SERVFAIL says the right thing — this query failed, ask someone else,
//! the endpoint is fine.
//!
//! As with DNS and DoT, the transaction id and the question section must be echoed. A reply
//! that fails either is discarded by the client and is worth exactly as much as silence, which
//! is why they are asserted here rather than just the RCODE.
//!
//! `dns` and `dot` and `mdns` each had a failure test and DoH did not; this closes that gap.
