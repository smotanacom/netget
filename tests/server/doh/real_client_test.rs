//! The real `kdig` binary — Knot DNS, a C implementation — against NetGet's DoH server.
//!
//! # Why this test exists
//!
//! `doh`'s Beta rating rested on `reqwest`, which is a genuinely independent HTTP/2 and TLS
//! implementation — and on **hickory-proto** for the DNS message, which is the codec this server
//! encodes with. So the transport half was proved and the DNS half was circular: it showed our
//! encoder agrees with our decoder. The protocol's own `e2e_testing` said exactly that.
//!
//! The root CLAUDE.md is blunt about the general form: a generic HTTP client "proves an HTTP
//! server answers, not that the protocol on top is right". reqwest is that generic client here.
//!
//! `kdig` is a DNS resolver that speaks RFC 8484 itself. It picks the transaction id, matches
//! the reply against it, confirms the question section, and renders the answer through its own
//! presentation writer — none of which our own codec can check on our behalf.
//!
//! # Both RFC 8484 encodings, by a client that chose them
//!
//! `+https` POSTs `application/dns-message`; `+https-get` sends `GET ?dns=<base64url>`. The
//! existing test covers both too, but with request bytes this repository built. Here the client
//! decides the framing, the base64url padding and the headers.
//!
//! Everything binds to 127.0.0.1. The certificate is self-signed and kdig's opportunistic
//! profile does not authenticate it, which is what lets this run without provisioning a CA —
//! and is also why certificate validation stays unproven.
