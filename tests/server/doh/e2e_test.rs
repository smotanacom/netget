    // reqwest hands the URL's host to its DNS resolver unconditionally. `hyper-util`'s default

    // hundred test processes ask it at once. It blocked for **8.25 seconds** in a measured
    // failing run, out of this request's 10-second budget.
    //
    // The measurement that pinned it: a raw `TcpStream::connect` to the same port, issued from
    // this same test on the same runtime immediately beforehand, completed in **464µs** and the
    // server logged the accept — while reqwest's own connect had still not reached the server
    // 8 seconds later. So the machine, the runtime and the server were all healthy; only the
