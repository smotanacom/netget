//! OAuth2's connection bounds, driven from the wire.
//!
//! `src/server/oauth2/mod.rs` declares three numbers and argues each beside itself:
//! `FIRST_BYTE_READ_TIMEOUT` (30s — HTTP is client-speaks-first, so a peer that has sent no byte
//! has asked nothing), `IDLE_BETWEEN_REQUESTS_TIMEOUT` (60s — between Apache's browser-tuned
//! `KeepAliveTimeout` of 5s and nginx's pool-tuned 75s, because both kinds of client reach these
//! endpoints.) and
//! `MAX_CONNECTIONS` (256). A bound nobody tested is a comment, so these drive all three from
//! a socket.
//!
//! The mechanics, the three-socket design and the removal-verification notes are in
//! `tests/helpers/http_bounds.rs`; this file supplies only what is specific to OAuth2.
//!
//! Run with:
//!   ./cargo-isolated.sh test --no-default-features --features oauth2 \
//!       --test server::oauth2::connection_bounds_test -- --test-threads=100
