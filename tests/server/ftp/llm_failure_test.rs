//! What an FTP client gets when the LLM backend fails: a 4xx, never silence.
//!
//! The command path already answered 421. The greeting did not: it logged the failure and
//! carried on into the command loop, so the client sat blocked reading a banner it may not
//! proceed without - an FTP client is not permitted to send a command until it has read a
//! greeting, so the whole session stalled before it began.
//!
//! RFC 959 defines 421 as the reply a server sends when it is declining the session, and the
//! control connection closes afterwards. Same shape as SMTP's 421, for the same reason.
