//! The fail-open this closes: an HTTP proxy that forwards everything when the LLM is down.
//!
//! `consult_llm_http_request` returning `Err` defaulted to `RequestAction::Pass`, which sends
//! the request on to its destination unfiltered. So a proxy whose entire purpose is to let a
//! model decide what may leave the network became an open relay for exactly as long as the
//! backend was unreachable - and the access log recorded each request as having been passed on
//! purpose, so nothing about the outage was visible after the fact either.
//!
//! Its HTTPS twin, `consult_llm_https_connection`, always defaulted to Block. Only the HTTP
//! path fell open, which is the kind of asymmetry that survives review because each half looks
//! reasonable on its own.
//!
//! The assertion that matters is not the status code the client sees. It is that the target
//! server was never contacted at all.
