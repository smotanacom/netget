//! The connection cap on a real, running HTTP proxy, driven from the wire.
//!
//! A proxy connection is the most expensive kind in this tree: a `CONNECT` tunnel holds a
//! *second* socket to the upstream for as long as the client keeps it, so an uncapped accept
//! loop exhausts descriptors at twice the rate, and with MITM enabled each one also drives a TLS
//! handshake and a certificate mint. Until September 2026 this accept loop admitted every
//! connection offered to it.
//!
//! Three claims:
//!
//! 1. `MAX_CONNECTIONS` clients are admitted.
//! 2. The next one is refused with **HTTP 503 + `Retry-After`**. A proxy speaks HTTP to its
//!    client whatever the client is asking for — a plain request gets an HTTP response, and a
//!    `CONNECT` gets an HTTP status line before any tunnel exists (RFC 9110 §9.3.6) — so one 503
//!    is correct for both and neither is mis-parsed.
//! 3. Closing an admitted connection **frees exactly one slot**. A permit dropped before the
//!    connection ends un-caps the proxy silently; one never released wedges it shut after
//!    `MAX_CONNECTIONS` clients have ever connected.
//!
//! **How this was proved to fail without the cap**: replace the `accept_bounded` call in
//! `src/server/proxy/mod.rs` with a bare `listener.accept().await` (and drop the permit from the
//! connection task). The over-cap client is then admitted and, having sent no request line, is
//! answered with nothing — so the `read_to_end` times out and the test fails on "was neither
//! answered nor closed".
//!
//! Loopback only, and nothing is proxied anywhere: every peer here connects and stays silent.
//!
//! Run with:
//!   ./cargo-isolated.sh test --no-default-features --features proxy --test server -- proxy::connection_bounds --test-threads=100
