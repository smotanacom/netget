//! What an NTP client gets when the LLM backend fails while the operator opted into LLM
//! control: a Kiss-o'-Death, not silence and not a usable time sample.
//!
//! This test used to assert the opposite — a stratum-2 answer carrying the true current time —
//! on the reasoning that the truth cannot be a lie in the operator's favour. That argument is
//! about the *content* of the reply and misses what the reply *is*: a stratum-2 packet is an
//! affirmative assertion that this server is a usable time source, and the client steps its
//! clock from it. An operator who pointed NTP at a model asked for the model to decide; when
//! the backend is unreachable, answering anyway on the server's own authority is a fail-open.
//!
//! RFC 5905 §7.4 gives NTP the one thing it needs here: a Kiss-o'-Death (stratum 0, LI 3, a
//! four-character kiss code) can never be mistaken for a time sample, so it fails closed —
//! while still being a *reply*, so the client backs off instead of polling a server it thinks
//! is merely slow. `RATE` says the backend is saturated, `INIT` that it is unavailable.
//!
//! The packet is decoded here byte by byte against the RFC's field layout rather than through
//! the server's own builder, so the test is evidence and not a tautology.
