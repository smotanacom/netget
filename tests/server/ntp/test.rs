//! End-to-end NTP tests for NetGet
//!
//! These tests spawn the actual NetGet binary with NTP prompts and validate the replies
//! byte by byte, plus with `rsntp` acting as a real SNTP client.
//!
//! Every assertion here used to be a `println!`. `test_ntp_basic_query` and
//! `test_ntp_time_sync` caught `rsntp`'s error, printed "this may be expected if LLM doesn't
//! fully implement NTP", then fell back to a raw socket whose three outcomes — a response, an
//! I/O error, and a timeout — were all printed and none asserted.
//! `test_ntp_stratum_levels` parsed the stratum out of byte 1 and printed it without
//! comparing it to anything. The suite therefore passed whether the server answered
//! correctly, answered garbage, or never answered at all.
//!
//! Two things make the difference concrete:
//!
//! - `rsntp` must now *succeed*. Its checks are the ones that matter for interoperability:
//!   the reply's originate timestamp must equal the request's transmit timestamp verbatim,
//!   mode must be server, stratum must not be 0, transmit must be non-zero, and the version
//!   must be the 4 it sent. A blocking `SntpClient` cannot be used from a `#[tokio::test]`
//!   here — the mock Ollama server is in-process, so blocking the runtime deadlocks the very
//!   LLM call the reply depends on, which is likely why the old fallback path existed at all.
//!   `AsyncSntpClient` is used throughout.
//! - The raw test decodes all 48 bytes and compares every field to what the handler asked
//!   for, including the origin-timestamp echo and the version echo.
//!
//! LLM call budget: 3 startups + 4 request events = 7 calls.
