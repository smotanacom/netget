//! Every NTP request leaves a `decision=` token in the log, and the token tells the truth
//! about what the client received.
//!
//! This test was written to pin an awkwardness that no longer exists, and the history is the
//! useful part. NTP used to answer a backend failure with the mechanical stratum-2 time
//! response — an affirmative, usable time sample the client sets its clock from — so the
//! failure could not honestly be tagged `fail_closed_*` and was tagged
//! `decision=static_default_llm_error` instead. This file asserted that pairing, and said in
//! as many words that if the wire behaviour ever became a Kiss-o'-Death the stratum assertion
//! would fail first so the token had to be revisited in the same change. That is what
//! happened: `actions::build_kod_packet` was wired up, the fail-open closed, and the token
//! became `fail_closed_llm_error` / `fail_closed_llm_overloaded`.
//!
//! So what this test now pins is the *converse* obligation. `fail_closed_*` is a claim that
//! the peer was denied, and `grep decision=fail_closed` — the one diagnostic this repo
//! teaches — is only worth running if that claim is true. Both halves are asserted together
//! because either alone is meaningless: the log must carry the tag, and the wire must carry a
//! packet no client will take time from.
//!
//! See `src/server/ntp/CLAUDE.md`, "Failure behaviour".
