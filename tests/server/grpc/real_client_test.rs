//! gRPC against a real, independent third-party client: **grpcurl 1.9.4**.
//!
//! # Why this test exists
//!
//! `tests/server/grpc/e2e_test.rs` drives the server with `reqwest` in
//! `.http2_prior_knowledge()` mode and reads the `grpc-status` header. That proves an HTTP/2
//! server answered; it does not prove a gRPC client can use the answer, because **reqwest does
//! not implement gRPC** — it never looks for trailers, never decodes the length-prefixed
//! message framing, and never turns protobuf bytes back into fields. The root `CLAUDE.md`
//! lists `grpc` among the protocols whose evidence is "codecs and parsers rather than clients"
//! for exactly this reason.
//!
//! grpcurl is the gRPC project's own command-line client, built on grpc-go. It applies grpc-go's
//! rules about where a status may appear, strips the 5-byte length prefix, and decodes the
//! protobuf payload against the schema — so what it prints is our wire bytes interpreted by a
//! real gRPC implementation.
//!
//! # Not circular
//!
//! NetGet's gRPC server frames with `hyper` + `prost`/`prost-reflect`; `tonic` is a dependency
//! of the feature but the serving path here is hyper's `http2::Builder` directly. grpcurl is a
//! Go binary that links none of it.
//!
//! # Reflection is NOT served, so the schema comes from the client side
//!
//! `tonic-reflection` is a declared dependency and is referenced nowhere in `src/`; a
//! reflection call is answered `12 UNIMPLEMENTED`. So `grpcurl` is given the same `.proto` the
//! server was started with, via `-import-path`/`-proto`, rather than `-use-reflection`.

/// Measured 16 September 2026 with grpcurl 1.9.4:
///
/// ```text
/// ERROR:
///   Code: Internal
///   Message: server closed the stream without sending trailers
/// ```
///
/// gRPC requires the status of a response **that carried a message** to arrive in an HTTP/2
/// TRAILERS frame. `src/server/grpc/mod.rs` used to write `grpc-status` into the *initial*
/// HEADERS and emit no trailers at all. For a successful call the body is non-empty, so
/// `http_body_util::Full::is_end_stream()` is false and hyper emitted HEADERS (no END_STREAM)
/// then DATA (END_STREAM) — a stream that ends with no trailers, which grpc-go rejects with the
/// message above.
///
/// **The error path next door did not hit this, and the asymmetry is the whole explanation.**
/// An error has an empty body, `is_end_stream()` is true, and hyper emits one HEADERS frame
/// with END_STREAM — a valid gRPC **Trailers-Only** response, which grpc-go accepts. So NetGet
/// could report a failure to a real gRPC client and could not report a success. That is why
/// every test in the tree passed: the failure paths were the ones being asserted on.
///
/// The server now builds the success reply as a two-frame body — the length-prefixed message,
/// then `Frame::trailers` carrying the status — and keeps the Trailers-Only shape for errors,
/// which was already correct. `src/server/etcd/mod.rs` had the identical defect and was fixed
/// the same way at the same time.
///
/// This test was written `#[ignore]`d, deliberately: asserting the broken behaviour would have
/// enshrined it and failed the day somebody fixed it. It is now the regression test.
