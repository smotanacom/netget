# Generic gRPC Server Verification

Experimental expanded unary/streaming/reflection scope. No checks skip missing peers.

`streaming_test.rs` uses mandatory independently generated grpcio 1.75.1 (C++ transport) and
grpcurl 1.9.4 (grpc-go) for all three stream forms/gzip and reflection list/describe/invoke
without a supplied proto. grpcio checks v1alpha; generated tonic v1 checks query and wire
bounds. Native requests verify exact 4 MiB/+1 before/after gzip,128/+1 reflection queries,
64 KiB/+1 reflection messages, opt-out, parked-handler cancellation/server removal, whole
RPC deadlines including unclosed input,64 global admission and released-slot recovery.

`schema_bounds_test.rs` checks exact 4 MiB/+1 startup descriptors,128/+1 files, built-in
reflection totals, reserved descriptors, depth 32/+1, expanded-name/node preflight and typed
stream schema exclusions (nested bytes and 128/+1 fields). No raw descriptor reaches a model.

Pinned peer environment: install `tests/helpers/grpcio-peer-requirements.txt` into an owned
venv and set NETGET_GRPCIO_PYTHON to its Python. grpcio/tools/reflection1.75.1,protobuf 6.32.1,
setuptools 80.9.0,typing_extensions 4.15.0. protoc 36.1 and grpcurl 1.9.4 are mandatory. Peer
servers bind port0 directly and report readiness; Rust owns/kills each fixture child.
TLS fixture needs openssl. Test commands use the programme shared run_cargo.py guard.

Legacy checks remain: five mocked unary schema/routing checks; two mandatory grpcurl
unary success/error checks; failure/status classification and connection bounds. Raw HTTP/2
reqwest/prost probes are useful for framing but cannot inspect trailers and are not an
independent gRPC implementation. The expanded scope is Experimental; no pcap/fuzz claim.

## Unary trailers regression evidence

That gap hid a defect that broke **every successful RPC** against a real client. Until
September 2026 the server wrote `grpc-status` into the initial HEADERS and emitted no trailers;
a success has a non-empty body, so the stream ended after DATA with nothing, and grpcurl
answered `Internal: server closed the stream without sending trailers` to every call. Errors
were unaffected — an empty body makes them Trailers-Only by accident — so **only the success
path was broken and the failure paths were the ones being asserted on**. `test_grpc_unary_rpc_basic`
asserted `grpc-status: 0` *on the initial headers*, which is precisely the assertion that kept
the bug satisfied; it now asserts that header is absent and checks the reply frame instead.

The success test in `real_client_test.rs` was written `#[ignore]`d against the broken server,
describing correct behaviour rather than the behaviour of the day. It is now un-ignored and is
the regression test.


The 30s preface deadline and 900s idle watchdog retain their prior wire tests. A silent peer
closes; a peer that sent the preface gets a SETTINGS ACK 38s later. Removing the peek timeout
makes the silent-peer test fail at its 70s window. The watchdog is idle-only; new stream
body guards and deadlines cover parked model work and response flow control independently.

## Current execution

Final server suite: 24 passed, 0 failed/ignored at 100 threads, 38.52s (includes12 retained
unary/status/connection checks). Log: programme logs/item68-grpc-server-full.log.
Earlier fixture compile errors, incorrect status/header expectations and the missing
second tonic readiness poll remain in the preparatory logs; none is claimed as a pass.
