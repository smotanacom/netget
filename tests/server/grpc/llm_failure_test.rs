//! What a gRPC client gets when the LLM backend fails: a non-zero status, and which one.
//!
//! This server already answered on this path — it never went silent — so what is under test is
//! the *choice of code*. Every handler failure was reported as `13 INTERNAL`, including the ones
//! caused by the LLM rate limiter refusing a request because the backend was saturated.
//! `INTERNAL` is explicitly **not** in gRPC's retryable set and is not a code any
//! `grpc-service-config` `retryableStatusCodes` list names, so a backlog that would clear in
//! seconds reached every caller as a permanent application error and no retry policy could act
//! on it.
//!
//! Two things are asserted, and they need different techniques:
//!
//! * **On the wire**, that a plain backend failure produces HTTP 200 with `grpc-status: 13` and
//!   an empty body — read from the response headers rather than through a client that could
//!   synthesise a status of its own.
//! * **In the classifier**, that an overload maps to `14 UNAVAILABLE` while everything else
//!   stays `13 INTERNAL`. This half cannot be driven end-to-end: the only errors
//!   `crate::llm::is_overload_error` recognises come from the rate limiter, whose bounds are set
//!   by `--llm-queue-timeout` / `--llm-max-queued`, and `tests/helpers/netget.rs` passes neither
//!   (only `--llm-max-concurrent`, at 1000). Reaching `QueueFull` through the harness would need
//!   129 requests in flight against a mock that answers instantly. So the classification is
//!   exercised directly rather than faked with an assertion that proves nothing.
//!
//! A third case is covered by `test_grpc_answers_internal_when_handler_returns_no_usable_action`:
//! the handler *succeeds* but returns an action that is neither `grpc_unary_response` nor
//! `grpc_error`. `handle_unary` used to fall back to encoding an empty `DynamicMessage` and ship it
//! as `grpc-status: 0` — indistinguishable from a deliberate empty response — which is the
//! fail-open this sweep exists to close. It now answers `13 INTERNAL` with an empty body, so the
//! only reply carrying `grpc-status: 0` is one the handler actually produced.
//!
//! The empty-body assertion matters as much as the code: a gRPC failure carries no message frame,
//! so `grpc-status: 0` plus a five-byte frame and `grpc-status: 13` plus nothing are what
//! distinguish "the model answered" from "the model said nothing usable" or "the model could not
//! be reached".
