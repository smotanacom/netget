//! The first-byte deadline on a real, running gRPC server, driven from the wire.
//!
//! Before September 2026 this server accepted without limit and bounded no read in time: a peer
//! that connected and said nothing held a socket, a connection task and an `AppState` entry
//! forever, pre-authentication, on a server that would happily accept a hundred more.
//!
//! Two properties are asserted here, and each one alone would be satisfied by a bug:
//!
//! 1. A peer that connects and **says nothing** is closed at `FIRST_BYTE_READ_TIMEOUT`.
//! 2. A peer that sends the **HTTP/2 connection preface** is served, and survives well past that
//!    same bound. gRPC multiplexes many RPCs over one long-lived connection, so a bound that
//!    closed a peer 30 seconds after it connected — rather than 30 seconds after it went quiet
//!    without ever speaking — would break every client.
//!
//! The bytes here are raw HTTP/2 rather than a gRPC call, deliberately: what is under test is
//! the deadline in front of hyper, and the preface plus an empty SETTINGS frame is the smallest
//! thing that makes hyper answer. `real_client_test.rs` is where grpcurl proves the protocol.
//!
//! **How this was proved to fail without the bound**: delete the `tokio::time::timeout(...)`
//! around `stream.peek(...)` in `src/server/grpc/mod.rs` and the first test hangs for its whole
//! 70-second window and then fails with "still holding the socket".
//!
//! The idle-between-requests bound is 900s, which no test can sit out. What is testable about
//! it — that a connection with work in flight is never reported as idle — is covered by
//! `tests/accept_bounded_test.rs` against the shared `ConnectionActivity`, and the wiring by
//! `tests/tcp_server_bounds_ratchet_test.rs`.
//!
//! Run with:
//!   ./cargo-isolated.sh test --no-default-features --features grpc,tcp --test server -- connection_bounds --test-threads=100
