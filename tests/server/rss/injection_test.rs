//! Model-supplied feed content must not be able to forge feed structure.
//!
//! RSS is XML generated from strings the model wrote, which is the CR/LF-injection class in an
//! XML costume: if a title containing `</title></item><item><title>` reached the document
//! verbatim, one model answer could manufacture entries the operator never asked for, and a
//! `]]>` inside an item description could close the CDATA section the `rss` crate puts it in
//! and turn the rest of that description into markup. The same shape turned a 331 into a login
//! in FTP.
//!
//! It does not, and this test is the measurement rather than the assumption. The mechanism is
//! in the `rss` crate and is worth naming so a future dependency bump is checked against it:
//!
//! * text elements go through `quick_xml::events::BytesText::new`, which is documented as
//!   taking an *unescaped* string and escapes it on write — so `<`, `>` and `&` cannot open a
//!   tag;
//! * an item's `<description>` and `<content:encoded>` are the exception — they are emitted as
//!   CDATA via `BytesCData::escaped`, which **splits** the content on `]]>` into consecutive
//!   CDATA sections rather than escaping it, so the terminator cannot appear inside one;
//! * a category's `domain` is an XML attribute, and `BytesStart::push_attribute` escapes
//!   attribute values, so a `"` cannot close it.
//!
//! What no escaping can fix, and what netget therefore filters itself, is the set of characters
//! XML 1.0 §2.2 forbids outright. There is no entity for NUL; a raw one in a title yields a
//! document every conforming reader rejects, so the server would answer 200 with something
//! unparseable. `xml_safe` drops them and the last test here proves a feed survives one.
//!
//! The evidence is `feed-rs`, not the `rss` crate: parsing our own output with the library that
//! produced it would show only that one crate round-trips through itself, which is exactly the
//! circularity that held this protocol at Experimental. A second implementation reading the
//! bytes off the socket is the only thing that settles what a real reader sees.
