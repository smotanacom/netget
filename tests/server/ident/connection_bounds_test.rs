//! The connection cap on a real, running Ident server, driven from the wire.
//!
//! `QUERY_READ_TIMEOUT` bounds how long *one* connected-but-silent peer holds a socket, a task
//! and an `AppState` row. It says nothing about how many such peers there can be at once, and
//! until September 2026 this accept loop admitted every connection offered to it.
//!
//! Three claims, and the second is the unusual one:
//!
//! 1. `MAX_CONNECTIONS` peers are admitted.
//! 2. The next one is closed **with nothing written**, and this is the right answer rather than
//!    a shortcut. Every reply RFC 1413 defines — `USERID` and all four `ERROR` tokens — opens by
//!    echoing the *port pair from the query*, and a peer over the cap has not sent a query. A
//!    reply carrying invented ports is worse than silence: a client matches the pair against its
//!    own outstanding request and records a protocol violation instead of backing off. So the
//!    assertion is exactly "zero bytes, then EOF, promptly" — which is also what distinguishes a
//!    refused peer from an admitted one here, since an admitted peer is *not* closed and simply
//!    waits for its query.
//! 3. Closing an admitted connection **frees exactly one slot**. A permit dropped before the
//!    connection ends un-caps the server silently; one never released wedges it shut after
//!    `MAX_CONNECTIONS` peers have ever connected.
//!
//! **How this was proved to fail without the cap**: replace the `accept_bounded` call in
//! `src/server/ident/mod.rs` with a bare `listener.accept().await` (and drop the permit from the
//! connection task). The over-cap peer is then admitted, so it is not closed, the `read_to_end`
//! times out and the test fails on "was neither answered nor closed".
//!
//! The server is model-free: an empty instruction really is model-free, where `None` is replaced
//! by a default one. Ident is client-speaks-first, so a silent peer provokes no model call.
//! Loopback only.
//!
//! Run with:
//!   ./cargo-isolated.sh test --no-default-features --features ident --test server -- ident::connection_bounds --test-threads=100
