//! End-to-end Ident (RFC 1413) tests.
//!
//! **Every test here drives a raw `TcpStream`, and that is the ceiling on what this suite can
//! prove.** There is no runnable third-party ident *client* to point at the server: crates.io
//! has no RFC 1413 client, macOS ships no `ident`/`identd` client binary and Homebrew has no
//! formula for one, and PyPI has nothing working. The realistic real-world client is an IRC
//! daemon (`ngircd` links `libident`), but every ident client hardcodes destination port 113
//! — RFC 1413 has no notion of a configurable server port — so none can be aimed at an
//! ephemeral loopback port, and 113 needs root. A client written inside this file is, in this
//! repo's own words, "an independent reading of the spec, not an independent implementation",
//! which is why the protocol is rated `Experimental` and not `Beta`. See
//! `tests/server/ident/CLAUDE.md`.
//!
//! What the raw socket *can* prove is everything below the maturity bar, and the three
//! properties that actually break clients are each pinned here:
//!
//! * the reply echoes the queried port pair **verbatim** — a client matches its query to a
//!   reply by that pair, so getting it wrong is indistinguishable from no reply at all;
//! * whitespace around the comma parses, because that is what the grammar allows and what
//!   real queries carry;
//! * a port outside `1..=65535` is refused **without an LLM call**. That is asserted by
//!   count, not by inspection: the `ident_query` rule expects exactly one call while four
//!   malformed queries are sent, so any of them reaching the model fails `verify_mocks()`.
