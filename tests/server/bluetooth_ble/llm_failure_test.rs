//! What a BLE central gets when the LLM backend fails: an ATT error response, not a value.
//!
//! BLE has no status line and no error document. What it has is the ATT error response, and the
//! only honest one available through `ble-peripheral-rust` is `UnlikelyError` (ATT error code
//! 0x0E) — there is no "temporarily unavailable" in the `RequestResponse` enum, so the overload
//! distinction that etcd and gRPC can express on the wire stays in the log here.
//!
//! Getting it wrong on a read is the more dangerous half. The success path falls back to the
//! characteristic's last cached value when the handler produced no `respond_to_read` action, so
//! answering `Success` on a *failure* would hand the central a stale reading it would treat as
//! current — the fail-open shape the root CLAUDE.md warns about, in a protocol where the value
//! is the whole payload. On a write the acknowledgement is the lie: an ATT Write Response means
//! "accepted", and the handler that would have accepted it never ran.
//!
//! # Why these tests drive the event loop directly
//!
//! Every test in `e2e_test.rs` is `#[ignore]`d, because a GATT read needs a Bluetooth adapter
//! *and* a second radio acting as a central, and under the project's standard
//! `--test-threads=100` they contend for the machine's single adapter and all time out. The
//! request/response paths under test here are entirely radio-independent: they run inside
//! `BluetoothBle::event_loop`, which consumes `PeripheralEvent`s from a channel and answers on a
//! `oneshot` responder. `BluetoothBle::run_event_loop_without_radio` exposes that loop with a
//! `ServerData` holding no `Peripheral`, so these tests exercise the real code with no hardware,
//! deterministically, in milliseconds.
//!
//! The LLM failure is forced by pointing the client at `127.0.0.1:1`, where nothing listens.
//! That is a connection refusal rather than an HTTP 500, but it arrives at exactly the same
//! place — `call_llm` returning `Err` — and it needs no mock harness, which cannot be used here
//! because starting the netget binary with a BLE server needs the adapter these tests avoid.
