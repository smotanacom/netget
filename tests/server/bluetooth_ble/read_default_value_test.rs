//! The read path: what a `bluetooth_read_request` answers when the handler call *succeeds* but
//! does not hand back a usable value.
//!
//! Three outcomes have to stay apart, because ATT carries only "here is a value" or an error
//! code and cannot express the difference itself:
//!
//! * the handler answered without naming a value (`decision=model_silent`) → serve the
//!   characteristic's stored value. That value is this server's own state (`add_service`'s
//!   `initial_value`, a `send_notification`, or the last write), so serving it is ordinary GATT
//!   behaviour, not an invention.
//! * the handler named no value and nothing is stored
//!   (`decision=fail_closed_model_silent_no_value`) → ATT Unlikely Error. An empty `Success`
//!   would assert that the characteristic holds zero bytes, which nothing here knows.
//! * the handler named a value that will not decode (`decision=fail_closed_bad_value`) → ATT
//!   Unlikely Error. The model *tried* to say what the characteristic holds; quietly serving the
//!   stored value instead would hand the central a different value under `Success`.
//!
//! The stored-value case also guards a fixed defect: that fallback used to acquire the
//! `ServerData` lock with `futures::executor::block_on(server_data.lock())` inside a synchronous
//! `unwrap_or_else` closure — a blocking lock on a tokio worker thread, which can panic ("Cannot
//! block the current thread from within a runtime") into the `tokio::spawn` that swallows it, so
//! the read dies while the server still looks healthy. It shows up here as the responder never
//! answering, caught by the 20s timeout.
//!
//! Everything runs against the real `BluetoothBle::event_loop` via `run_event_loop_without_radio`
//! — no Bluetooth hardware, byte-for-byte the request/response paths a real central drives.
