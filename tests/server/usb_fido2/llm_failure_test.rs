//! What a CTAP host gets when the LLM backend fails.
//!
//! The failure is forced by configuring a mock for the *startup* instruction only. Every event
//! the protocol raises then matches no rule, the mock Ollama server answers HTTP 500, and
//! `call_llm` returns `Err` — the same shape as a real backend outage, an overload, or a
//! malformed model response.
//!
//! FIDO2 already failed *closed*: `ApprovalManager::wait` denies on expiry, so a credential
//! could never be issued by an outage. What it did not do is say so promptly. The host had
//! already been told `KEEPALIVE(UPNEEDED)` and would keep polling for up to
//! `approval_timeout_secs` — 30s by default — for an answer that was never coming, because the
//! LLM error was logged and then dropped on the floor.
//!
//! So the assertion here is two-part, and both halves matter:
//!
//! 1. **The status is `CTAP2_ERR_OPERATION_DENIED` (0x27)** — CTAP2's own word for "the user
//!    said no", which is the same thing an explicit `deny_request` produces and the only
//!    honest thing to say when the decision could not be obtained. Never an attestation.
//! 2. **It arrives in a fraction of the approval window.** The test sets a 30s window and
//!    requires an answer inside 12s, so a regression that goes back to waiting out the timeout
//!    fails here rather than merely being slow.
//!
//! And, because this is the protocol where a fail-open would be worst: after the failure the
//! store must still be empty. A GetAssertion for the same relying party must report
//! `CTAP2_ERR_NO_CREDENTIALS`, which can only hold if no key pair was ever generated.
