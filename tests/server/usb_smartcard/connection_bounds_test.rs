//! The read deadlines on a real, running USB smart card server, driven from a raw socket.
//!
//! The mechanics and the full argument are in `tests/helpers/usbip_bounds.rs`, because all six
//! USB servers hand their socket to the same screen (`src/server/usb/guard.rs`) and there is
//! exactly one place in the process that reads from it. This file supplies what is specific to
//! USB smart card: its registry name, and the sentence below.
//!
//! A CCID reader answers every bulk message synchronously — an APDU the model has not answered
//! yet comes back as the card's own 'not ready' rather than by holding the URB — so the idle
//! bound never counts a model round-trip here either.
//!
//! Run with:
//!   ./cargo-isolated.sh test --no-default-features --features usb-smartcard --test server -- \
//!       usb_smartcard::connection_bounds --test-threads=100
