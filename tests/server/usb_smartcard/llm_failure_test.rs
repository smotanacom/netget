//! What a smart card host gets when the LLM backend fails.
//!
//! The failure is forced by configuring a mock for the *startup* instruction only. Every event
//! the protocol raises then matches no rule, the mock Ollama server answers HTTP 500, and
//! `call_llm` returns `Err` — the same shape as a real backend outage.
//!
//! Unlike the rest of the USB family this protocol was already correct: `answer_apdu` returns
//! `ApduResponse::card_error()` — ISO 7816-4 **`6F00`**, "no precise diagnosis" — when the
//! handler errors, says nothing, or says something undecodable, and there is no path to `9000`.
//! This test exists to keep it that way, because the property is invisible from the source of
//! any one function: `6F00` is produced in three different arms and a refactor that lost one of
//! them would leave a card that answers `9000` during an outage.
//!
//! A status word is the right vocabulary here rather than a bare USB STALL: `6F00` is what the
//! *card* says, which is the layer the host's PC/SC stack is asking a question at. STALLing the
//! endpoint would fail the reader instead, and a host cannot tell a failed reader from an
//! unplugged one.
//!
//! Two further properties asserted below:
//!
//! * The **reader still works**. `IccPowerOn` returns the default ATR and the slot reports a
//!   card, because the startup event failing means "unconfigured", not "broken" — opening a
//!   socket must not require the model to be reachable.
//! * The card **keeps answering**. A second APDU also gets `6F00`, so the host is never left on
//!   its own timeout.
