//! The read deadlines on a real, running OpenAI-compatible server, driven from a raw socket.
//!
//! This is a hyper server, so the two bounds are enforced in two different places and each
//! needs its own proof.
//!
//! **A peer that has connected and said nothing must eventually be let go of.** That one is a
//! `TcpStream::peek` *before* `serve_connection` is called: hyper owns every read afterwards
//! and keeps polling the connection while a request is being answered, so a deadline on its
//! reads would fire in the middle of a model round-trip — and on this server, where the answer
//! *is* model output, that round-trip is the normal case rather than the slow one. Remove the
//! peek in `src/server/openai/mod.rs` and the first test hangs until its own window expires.
//!
//! **An established keep-alive connection that goes silent must be let go of too**, and that
//! one is `watch_idle` over a `ConnectionActivity` the service holds busy for the whole of each
//! request. The second test drives `GET /v1/models` through a static routing rule — so no model
//! is involved — and then goes quiet on an otherwise healthy keep-alive connection. The two
//! bounds are set far apart and the wrong way round: a first-byte deadline applied to the whole
//! connection would keep this one for 60 seconds and time the assertion out.
//!
//! The values here are overrides, not the defaults. The shipped defaults are 30 seconds and 300
//! (argued beside `FIRST_BYTE_READ_TIMEOUT` and `IDLE_BETWEEN_REQUESTS_TIMEOUT`), and a test
//! that asserted them by waiting them out would be the slowest thing in the suite. That is why
//! both are declared startup parameters: what is asserted here is that each parameter is read
//! and applied to the bound it names; the *values* are argued where they are declared.
//!
//! The third test is not about a deadline: it checks that the connection-cap refusal this
//! server hands a peer over `MAX_CONNECTIONS` is a well-framed HTTP response. Its
//! `Content-Length` is written by hand in a byte-string literal, and a wrong one makes every
//! client hang waiting for a body that is not coming — which is a worse failure than the silent
//! close the refusal exists to replace.
//!
//! No mock backend: the LLM endpoint is a dead port. Loopback only.
//!
//! Run with:
//!   ./cargo-isolated.sh test --no-default-features --features openai --test server -- \
//!       openai::connection_bounds --test-threads=100
