//! A model-supplied `status` on `openai_error_response` narrowed with `as u16` became a 200.
//!
//! `65736 as u16` is `200`. This action is the only way the model can return an OpenAI-shaped
//! error, so the wrap handed the caller a 200 whose body happens to carry an `error` object —
//! which an OpenAI SDK reads as a successful completion with unexpected fields, not as a
//! refusal. Fail-open by arithmetic.
//!
//! Out of range is refused rather than clamped, and the message names the range so the repair
//! loop can correct the call.
