//! The read deadlines on a real, running RTSP server, driven from a raw socket.
//!
//! Two claims, and they are different claims, so each gets its own test.
//!
//! **A peer that has connected and said nothing must eventually be let go of.** Nothing else in
//! the process closes that socket: it holds a task, an `AppState` row and one of
//! `MAX_CONNECTIONS` slots, pre-authentication, so the server has to give up first. Remove the
//! deadline around `read_half.read(&mut chunk)` in `src/server/rtsp/mod.rs` and the first test
//! hangs until its own window expires.
//!
//! **Once a request has been answered the *idle* bound governs, not the first-byte one.** The
//! second test drives an OPTIONS through a static routing rule — so no model is involved — and
//! then goes quiet, with the two bounds set far apart and the wrong way round: if the read loop
//! kept using the first-byte bound after answering, that connection would live 60 seconds and
//! the assertion would time out.
//!
//! The values here are overrides, not the defaults. The shipped defaults are 30 seconds and 300
//! (argued beside `FIRST_BYTE_READ_TIMEOUT` and `IDLE_BETWEEN_REQUESTS_TIMEOUT`), and a test
//! that asserted them by waiting them out would be the slowest thing in the suite. That is why
//! both are declared startup parameters: what is asserted here is that each parameter is read
//! and applied to the read it names; the *values* are argued where they are declared.
//!
//! No mock backend: the LLM endpoint is a dead port. These tests assert on deadlines, not on
//! answers. Loopback only.
//!
//! Run with:
//!   ./cargo-isolated.sh test --no-default-features --features rtsp --test server -- \
//!       rtsp::connection_bounds --test-threads=100
