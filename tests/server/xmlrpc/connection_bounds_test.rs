//! XML-RPC's connection bounds, driven from the wire.
//!
//! `src/server/xmlrpc/mod.rs` declares three numbers and argues each beside itself:
//! `FIRST_BYTE_READ_TIMEOUT` (30s — HTTP is client-speaks-first, so a peer that has sent no byte
//! has asked nothing), `IDLE_BETWEEN_REQUESTS_TIMEOUT` (60s — a backstop rather than a keep-alive
//! allowance: Python's `xmlrpc.client.ServerProxy`, the canonical client, opens a connection per
//! call and closes it.) and
//! `MAX_CONNECTIONS` (256). A bound nobody tested is a comment, so these drive all three from
//! a socket.
//!
//! The mechanics, the three-socket design and the removal-verification notes are in
//! `tests/helpers/http_bounds.rs`; this file supplies only what is specific to XML-RPC.
//!
//! Run with:
//!   ./cargo-isolated.sh test --no-default-features --features xmlrpc \
//!       --test server::xmlrpc::connection_bounds_test -- --test-threads=100
