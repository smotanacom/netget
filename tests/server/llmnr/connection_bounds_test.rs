//! The connection cap on the LLMNR responder's TCP side, driven from the wire.
//!
//! LLMNR is a UDP-multicast protocol with a TCP listener beside it: RFC 4795 §2.4 requires
//! responders to support TCP queries, and it is the only transport on which a non-zero RCODE
//! may be returned. That listener is a real accept loop reachable by anyone who can open a
//! socket, and until September 2026 it admitted every connection offered to it.
//! `TCP_IDLE_TIMEOUT` (30s) bounds how long *one* silent querier holds a task and a descriptor;
//! thirty seconds multiplied by an unbounded arrival rate is not a bound.
//!
//! Three claims:
//!
//! 1. `MAX_CONNECTIONS` peers are admitted.
//! 2. The next one is closed **with nothing written**, and that is the right answer rather than
//!    a shortcut. LLMNR's only server message is a DNS response, and RFC 4795 §2.4 requires it
//!    to copy the query's ID and question section while §2.1 has the querier silently discard
//!    anything that does not match an outstanding query — so a fabricated response to a peer
//!    that has sent nothing would be dropped, leaving it to wait out its own timeout instead of
//!    the immediate EOF it gets here. Silence is also what this protocol does everywhere else:
//!    a responder that cannot answer simply says nothing.
//! 3. Closing an admitted connection **frees exactly one slot**. A permit dropped before the
//!    connection ends un-caps the responder silently; one never released wedges it shut after
//!    `MAX_CONNECTIONS` peers have ever connected.
//!
//! **Why there is no `wait_for_admitted` here, unlike the rest of this sweep.** This responder
//! registers a connection in `AppState` only when a query is *answered*, so a connected-but-
//! silent peer is invisible to the state it would poll. The ordering guarantee is the kernel's
//! instead: the listen backlog is FIFO and every one of the 256 `connect()` calls below has
//! returned before the 257th is even started, so the accept loop necessarily reaches them in
//! that order. Nothing here sleeps and hopes.
//!
//! Because the refusal is silence, "refused" and "admitted" are told apart by *time*: a refused
//! peer reads EOF at once, an admitted one is held for `TCP_IDLE_TIMEOUT`. The windows below
//! sit well inside that gap on both sides.
//!
//! **How this was proved to fail without the cap**: replace the `accept_bounded` call in
//! `src/server/llmnr/mod.rs` with a bare `listener.accept().await` (and drop the permit from
//! the connection task). The over-cap peer is then admitted and held for the full idle
//! deadline, and the test fails on "was neither answered nor closed".
//!
//! The server is model-free: an empty instruction really is model-free, where `None` is
//! replaced by a default one. No query is ever sent, so no model call is provoked. Multicast
//! joining is switched off so the test touches nothing but loopback.
//!
//! Run with:
//!   ./cargo-isolated.sh test --no-default-features --features llmnr --test server -- llmnr::connection_bounds --test-threads=100
