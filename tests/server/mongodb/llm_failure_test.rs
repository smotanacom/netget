//! What a MongoDB driver gets when the LLM backend fails: an `{ok: 0}` command reply.
//!
//! The failure propagated with `?`, which dropped the connection with nothing written. A
//! driver blocks on the reply to every command, so the operation hung until the driver's own
//! timeout and was then reported as a network fault - which sends a replica-set-aware driver
//! looking for another node rather than surfacing a server error.
//!
//! `{ok: 0, code, errmsg}` is the only shape a driver reads as a command failure. Anything
//! with `ok: 1` is a result, and for `find` an empty result means "no documents matched" - a
//! statement about the data that nothing here is in a position to make.
//!
//! The code is `InternalError` (1) whether or not the backend was merely saturated. MongoDB's
//! driver-retryable codes all describe replica-set failover (ShutdownInProgress,
//! PrimarySteppedDown, NotWritablePrimary) and claiming one would send the driver hunting for
//! a new primary that does not exist, so the overload distinction stays in the log.
