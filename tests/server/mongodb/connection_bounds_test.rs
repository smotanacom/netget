//! The header read deadline on a real, running MongoDB server, driven from the wire.
//!
//! `BODY_READ_TIMEOUT` used to be the only deadline in `run_session`, and it arms only *after*
//! a sixteen-byte header has arrived. So a peer that connected and sent nothing — or fewer
//! than sixteen bytes — parked the connection task in `read_exact` with no clock running at
//! all, holding the socket, the registered task and the `AppState` row until the peer itself
//! chose to close. The operator-visible form is worse: `[ disconnect this peer ]` half-closes
//! the write side and marks the row `Closed`, which a peer that is not reading never notices,
//! so the dashboard reported a hang-up that had not happened.
//!
//! `FIRST_HEADER_READ_TIMEOUT` (30s) and `IDLE_BETWEEN_MESSAGES_TIMEOUT` (600s) are the pair
//! the other seventeen TCP servers use, for the reason `whois` states: "has said nothing at
//! all" and "has gone quiet mid-session" are different claims and deserve different answers.
//!
//! **This test fails without the fix**: remove the `tokio::time::timeout` around the header
//! read and the first test hangs until its own 60s assertion window expires. The second test
//! is what stops a lazy fix — one short number applied to both reads would close an answered
//! connection at 30s, and it asserts that does not happen.
//!
//! Both deadlines are armed lazily, per read: the future is constructed at the top of the loop
//! after the previous message's work has finished, so no clock runs during an LLM round-trip
//! or a `manual` rule parked for a human. That is the property the TFTP eviction defect is
//! about, and the second test is also its evidence — a server answering a message spends time
//! outside the read.
//!
//! No mock backend: the LLM endpoint is a dead port. These tests assert on *deadlines*, not on
//! answers, and the first sends nothing at all; the second drives only the `hello` handshake,
//! which MongoDB answers in Rust with no model call (see `src/server/mongodb/mod.rs`).
//! Loopback only.
//!
//! Run with:
//!   ./cargo-isolated.sh test --no-default-features --features mongodb-server --test server -- mongodb::connection_bounds --test-threads=100

// The deadlines above bound how long *one* peer holds a connection. They say nothing about
// how many such peers there may be, and until September 2026 this accept loop admitted every
// connection offered to it — so `IDLE_BETWEEN_MESSAGES_TIMEOUT`'s ten minutes multiplied by an
// unbounded arrival rate was not a bound at all.
//
// Three claims below, and the second is the unusual one:
//
//  1. `MAX_CONNECTIONS` peers are admitted.
//  2. The next one is closed **with nothing written**, and that is the right answer rather than
//     a shortcut. Every MongoDB reply is addressed to a request through the header's
//     `responseTo`, which the driver matches against its own outstanding `requestID`; a peer
//     over the cap has sent nothing, so the only value available is zero. A driver receiving a
//     reply it did not ask for has no request to fail and simply discards it, so an invented
//     OP_MSG would leave the peer waiting out its own `connectTimeoutMS` — strictly worse than
//     the immediate EOF it gets here, which every driver already treats as a failed connection.
//  3. Closing an admitted connection **frees exactly one slot**. A permit dropped before the
//     connection ends un-caps the server silently; one never released wedges it shut after
//     `MAX_CONNECTIONS` peers have ever connected.
//
// Because the refusal is silence, "refused" and "admitted" are told apart by *time* rather
// than by content: a refused peer reads EOF at once, while an admitted one that says nothing
// is held for `FIRST_HEADER_READ_TIMEOUT` — thirty seconds — before this server closes it. The
// assertion windows below sit well inside that gap on both sides.
//
// **How this was proved to fail without the cap**: replace the `accept_bounded` call in
// `src/server/mongodb/mod.rs` with a bare `listener.accept().await` (and drop the permit from
// the connection task). The over-cap peer is then admitted and held for the full header
// deadline, and the test fails on "was neither answered nor closed".
