//! What a mass-storage host gets when the LLM backend fails.
//!
//! The failure is forced by configuring a mock for the *startup* instruction only. The
//! `usb_msc_attached` event then matches no rule, the mock Ollama server answers HTTP 500, and
//! `call_llm` returns `Err` — the same shape as a real backend outage.
//!
//! `usb_msc_attached` is the one event whose answer the host depends on: it is where the model
//! says what is on the drive (`serve_files`). Before this path existed, a failure there left the
//! device serving its default in-memory FAT16 volume — empty, but perfectly valid. A host would
//! mount it and find nothing, with no way to tell "the model was unreachable" from "the model
//! served an empty disk". That is the fail-open shape the project's OAuth2 post-mortem is about,
//! wearing a filesystem.
//!
//! SCSI already has the right words for a drive with nothing in it, so the device now says them:
//! CHECK CONDITION with sense NOT READY / MEDIUM NOT PRESENT (02/3A/00), which is exactly what
//! `eject_disk` produces for a deliberate ejection. INQUIRY still answers — that is how a host
//! learns the device exists at all, and refusing it would look like a broken device rather than
//! an empty one.
//!
//! Read and write events are deliberately *not* covered by any of this: they are notifications
//! about transfers the image has already served, so there is nothing the host is waiting for and
//! nothing to withdraw. They log at ERROR and stop.
