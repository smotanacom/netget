//! The read deadlines on a real, running USB mass storage server, driven from a raw socket.
//!
//! The mechanics and the full argument are in `tests/helpers/usbip_bounds.rs`, because all six
//! USB servers hand their socket to the same screen (`src/server/usb/guard.rs`) and there is
//! exactly one place in the process that reads from it. This file supplies what is specific to
//! USB mass storage: its registry name, and the sentence below.
//!
//! **Mass storage is the device that decides the idle number.** A host that has attached a drive
//! and not mounted it issues no URB at all, for as long as nobody touches it — so an idle bound
//! short enough to be interesting would unplug a perfectly healthy device, which is why the
//! default is 1800 seconds and exists to reap a peer that is gone rather than to police one that
//! is here.
//!
//! Run with:
//!   ./cargo-isolated.sh test --no-default-features --features usb-msc --test server -- \
//!       usb_msc::connection_bounds --test-threads=100
