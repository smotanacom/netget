//! E2E tests for the USB Mass Storage Class server.
//!
//! The question these answer is the concrete one: *pretend to be a USB drive and serve a
//! single file `hello.txt` containing `world`* — does that work?
//!
//! They drive a real USB/IP client over TCP (`tests/helpers/usbip_client.rs`): `OP_REQ_DEVLIST`
//! and `OP_REQ_IMPORT`, then Bulk-Only Transport CBW/CSW pairs carrying real SCSI commands. A
//! FAT16 volume is built in-process (`super::fat16`), handed to the server as
//! `startup_params.disk_image`, and read back sector by sector through `READ(10)`. The
//! assertion is on the bytes the host receives, so a broken SCSI path cannot pass.
//!
//! **What this does not prove.** There is no `vhci-hcd`, no `/dev/sdX`, no kernel filesystem
//! driver — macOS has no USB/IP client at all, which is why the protocol is spoken directly.
//! These tests establish that the *device side* is correct: netget puts the right bytes on the
//! wire for the right SCSI commands. They do not establish that Linux mounts the volume and
//! that `cat /mnt/hello.txt` prints `world`; that still needs a real host with the kernel
//! module and root.
//!
//! The previous version of this file connected a bare `TcpStream` and checked that an event
//! fired. That could not have caught any of what was actually broken: the server exported the
//! device on a second listener bound to the *client's* address and dropped the accepted socket,
//! every SCSI command panicked the moment it ran (`Handle::current().block_on` on a tokio
//! worker), control requests were routed to the bulk IN path, and three of the four events
//! could never fire.
