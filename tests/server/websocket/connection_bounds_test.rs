//! The connection cap and the idle bound on a real, running WebSocket server, driven from the
//! wire.
//!
//! `HANDSHAKE_TIMEOUT_SECS` (15s) bounds how long a peer may hold a connection *before* it has
//! sent a request head. After the upgrade a WebSocket is a session the client is entitled to hold
//! open with nothing to say, so the upgraded bound (`IDLE_TIMEOUT`) is on the peer's *liveness*
//! rather than its conversation — a keepalive Ping at half of it, which every client answers by
//! itself. The idle tests are described where they start, below the cap test.
//!
//! The cap test makes three claims:
//!
//! 1. `MAX_CONNECTIONS` peers are admitted, each completing a real RFC 6455 upgrade. Handshaking
//!    them rather than leaving them silent is what keeps claim 3 honest: a peer that only opens
//!    a socket is evicted after fifteen seconds, which would free slots on its own and let the
//!    slot-return assertion pass for a reason that has nothing to do with the permit.
//! 2. The next one is refused with `HTTP/1.1 503` and `Retry-After`. A WebSocket client is an
//!    HTTP client first — RFC 6455 §4.1 makes the opening handshake an ordinary GET and §4.2.2
//!    has the server answer anything it will not upgrade with a normal HTTP response — so 503
//!    is inside the protocol rather than beside it, and every client surfaces a non-101 status
//!    as a failed handshake carrying that code. A close frame would be wrong twice over: it
//!    belongs to a connection that was never upgraded, and the peer has no frame parser running.
//! 3. Closing an admitted connection **frees exactly one slot**, and this is the claim the
//!    server's own structure puts at risk. One upgraded WebSocket here is *two* tasks, and the
//!    read loop waits only five seconds for the writer before giving up on it, so the permit is
//!    an `Arc` held by both halves and the slot comes back when the later of the two ends.
//!    Holding it in the reader alone would release the slot while a writer was still draining.
//!
//! **How this was proved to fail without the cap**: replace the `accept_bounded` call in
//! `src/server/websocket/mod.rs` with a bare `listener.accept().await` (and drop the permit from
//! the connection task). The over-cap peer is then upgraded and the test fails on reading 101
//! where it demanded 503.
//!
//! The server is model-free. The handshake is answered by a static `accept_websocket` rule and
//! everything after it by a zero-action `*` rule, so 256 upgrades cost no model calls at all —
//! without that, each one would be an LLM round-trip against a dead endpoint. Loopback only.
//!
//! Run with:
//!   ./cargo-isolated.sh test --no-default-features --features websocket --test server -- websocket::connection_bounds --test-threads=100
