//! The connection cap on a real, running SMTP server, driven from the wire.
//!
//! `READ_TIMEOUT` is 300 seconds, which is RFC 5321 §4.5.3.2's own server-side command timeout
//! — so one stranger legitimately holds a socket, a task and an `AppState` row for five minutes.
//! Until September 2026 nothing bounded how many such strangers there could be: this accept loop
//! admitted every connection offered to it, and five minutes multiplied by an unbounded number
//! of connections is not a bound. A mail server is the canonical target for this, which is why
//! every real MTA ships a connection limit of its own.
//!
//! Three claims, and the second is where SMTP differs from everything else in this sweep:
//!
//! 1. `MAX_CONNECTIONS` peers are admitted.
//! 2. The next one is refused with a **421 greeting**. SMTP is server-speaks-first, so a refusal
//!    has a natural place: RFC 5321 §3.1 and §4.3.2 let the server open with something other
//!    than 220, and 421 — "Service not available, closing transmission channel" — is precisely
//!    this case. Postfix answers its own connection-count limit with a 421 greeting, so every
//!    MTA in the world already backs off on it rather than recording a permanent failure.
//! 3. Closing an admitted connection **frees exactly one slot**. A permit dropped before the
//!    connection ends un-caps the server silently; one never released wedges it shut after
//!    `MAX_CONNECTIONS` peers have ever connected.
//!
//! **How this was proved to fail without the cap**: replace the `accept_bounded` call in
//! `src/server/smtp/mod.rs` with a bare `listener.accept().await` (and drop the permit from the
//! connection task). The over-cap peer is then admitted and greeted with the static handler's
//! `220`, and the test fails on the 421 assertion.
//!
//! **The server here is model-free and has to be**, which is not true of most files in this
//! sweep. SMTP greets the peer, so every one of the 256 connections filling the cap would
//! otherwise be an LLM call against a dead endpoint — slow, and it would make the *admitted*
//! reply a `421 4.3.0 Service not available` that this test could not tell apart from the
//! refusal. A static `send_smtp_greeting` handler makes an admitted connection unambiguously a
//! `220`. Loopback only.
//!
//! Run with:
//!   ./cargo-isolated.sh test --no-default-features --features smtp --test server -- smtp::connection_bounds --test-threads=100
