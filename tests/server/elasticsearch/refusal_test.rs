//! What the Elasticsearch server must refuse rather than answer affirmatively.
//!
//! **An oversized request body.** `Incoming` has no default limit, so the handler buffered
//! whatever an unauthenticated peer chose to send — a single `POST /_bulk` was enough — and
//! the body is then embedded whole in an LLM prompt, so there is no legitimate large one
//! either. The refusal has to land *before* the model call, which is why this test counts
//! model calls as well as checking the status.
//!
//! **Responses that assert more than the handler did.** Three fields were declared
//! `required: true` and silently defaulted, and every default was the affirmative answer:
//! `send_index_response`'s `result` defaulted to `"created"`, which is what makes the reply a
//! 201; `send_cluster_health`'s `status` defaulted to `"green"`, so a handler that said
//! nothing reported a fully-allocated cluster; `send_get_response`'s `found` defaulted to
//! `false`, so a mistyped `"true"` (a string, not a JSON boolean) became "no such document".
//!
//! **`errors` in a bulk response.** Clients check it before deciding whether to walk `items`
//! at all, so defaulting it to `false` hid per-item failures the handler had itself reported.
//! It is now derived from the items when omitted — observable rather than assumed.
