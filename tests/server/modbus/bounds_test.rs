//! Every bound the Modbus server declares, driven from the wire.
//!
//! The Stable bar's fourth condition is "every declared bound has a test", and the coap pass
//! showed why it has to be read literally: a declared number can govern the other direction
//! from the one it reads as. So each test below names the bound, the direction it governs, and
//! what the peer sees on each side of it.
//!
//! | bound | direction | test |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | `codec::MAX_ADU_LEN` (260), declared as `max_inbound_bytes` | **inbound**: the MBAP length field a peer may announce | `the_largest_legal_adu_is_answered_and_one_octet_more_closes` |
//! | `MAX_BUFFERED` (2080) | inbound: bytes queued behind a request that is with the model | `bytes_queued_behind_a_parked_request_are_capped` |
//! | `MAX_CONNECTIONS` (256) | concurrent peers | `the_connection_cap_refuses_silently_and_every_close_returns_its_slot` |
//! | `first_byte_timeout_secs` / `idle_timeout_secs` | read deadlines, tunable | `both_read_deadlines_follow_their_startup_parameters` |
//! | quantity limits 2000 / 125 / 1968 / 123 | inbound PDU fields | `every_quantity_limit_is_exact` |
//! | `unit_id` | inbound routing | `a_request_for_another_unit_is_refused_with_exception_0x0b` |
//!
//! The *outbound* side of `MAX_ADU_LEN` — that no response this server frames can exceed it —
//! is `tests/codec_property_test.rs::modbus_props` (`adu_output_is_bounded`,
//! `read_responses_fit_a_legal_pdu`), and the defaults of the two read deadlines are
//! `connection_bounds_test.rs`.
//!
//! Each wire test was verified by removing its bound and watching it fail; the commit that
//! added this file records how.
//!
//! Every server here is model-free: an empty instruction really is model-free (`None` would
//! be replaced by a default instruction), and the requests used are either answered by the
//! specification with no model call or parked on a `manual` rule. Loopback only.
