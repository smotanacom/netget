//! The read deadlines on a real, running Modbus TCP server, driven from the wire.
//!
//! Modbus has **no authentication step of any kind**, so "pre-authentication" here means
//! "anyone who can reach the port". Before September 2026 this server accepted without limit and
//! bounded no read in time: such a peer could connect, say nothing, and hold a socket, a read
//! task, a peer handle and an `AppState` row forever, on a server that would happily accept a
//! hundred more.
//!
//! Two properties are asserted, and each one alone would be satisfied by a bug:
//!
//! 1. A peer that connects and **says nothing** is closed at `FIRST_BYTE_READ_TIMEOUT`, and
//!    closed *silently* — Modbus has no message a server may send unprompted, and inventing one
//!    means inventing a transaction.
//! 2. A peer that has **sent a request** survives well past that same bound. The longer bound
//!    exists because `handle_data` runs on its own task: the reader keeps reading while a
//!    request is being answered, so a peer waiting for its own reply — including one parked on a
//!    `manual` rule for a human — is silent on this socket for the whole of that work.
//!
//! **How this was proved to fail without the bound**: replace the `tokio::time::timeout(...)`
//! around `read_half.read(...)` in `src/server/modbus/mod.rs` with the bare call and the first
//! test hangs for its whole 70-second window, then fails with "still holding the socket".
//!
//! Run with:
//!   ./cargo-isolated.sh test --no-default-features --features modbus,tcp --test server -- modbus::connection_bounds --test-threads=100
