//! `src/server/modbus/CLAUDE.md`'s failure section, read as a list of assertions.
//!
//! The DNS pass found that a failure section is usually where a doc promises something the code
//! does not do — there, "answered SERVFAIL when the model returned nothing usable" described the
//! one case that wrote nothing at all. So each clause of Modbus's "Fail closed" list is driven
//! here, from the wire, and checked twice: the PDU the client receives, and the `decision=` token
//! the log carries — because on this protocol the wire *cannot* tell a model's deliberate 0x04
//! from a fail-closed one, and the log is the only place the difference lives.
//!
//! | clause | driven by | wire | log |
//! |---|---|---|---|
//! | the LLM call itself failed | a write, which no mock rule answers (the mock returns 500) | `0x86 0x04` | `fail_closed_llm_error` |
//! | no usable action came back | the model answers `[]` | `0x83 0x04` | `fail_closed_no_action` |
//! | wrong *kind*, from the model (bits for a register read) | `send_modbus_bits` to FC 3 | `0x83 0x04` | `fail_closed_llm_error` — see below |
//! | wrong *kind*, from the model (a write ack for a read) | `send_modbus_write_ack` to FC 1 | `0x81 0x04` | `fail_closed_llm_error` |
//! | wrong *kind*, from a static rule | `send_modbus_registers` to FC 1 | `0x81 0x04` | `fail_closed_wrong_shape` (second test) |
//! | wrong *number* of values | one register for a two-register read | `0x83 0x04` | `fail_closed_wrong_shape` |
//! | a register value outside 0-65535 | `65536`, refused by `execute_action` | `0x83 0x04` | `fail_closed_no_action` |
//! | the model's own 0x04 | `send_modbus_exception 4` | `0x83 0x04` | `model_reject` |
//!
//! **The wrong-kind rows are the finding.** The server's own doc said a model answering the
//! wrong kind is logged `fail_closed_wrong_shape`. It is not, because such an answer never
//! reaches the server: each event offers the model only its own actions, so `send_modbus_bits`
//! on a register read is an *unknown action* to the LLM layer, which re-asks once
//! (`MAX_UNKNOWN_ACTION_RETRIES` in `src/llm/conversation.rs` — hence the extra mock call on
//! each of those rules) and then fails the call. The wire is right either way; the log reads
//! `fail_closed_llm_error`, preceded by `LLM failed to use valid actions`. The server's
//! wrong-kind check is reached only by a handler that bypasses that vocabulary — a static or
//! script rule — which the second test drives.
//!
//! And a control: the same rule answering a correct request correctly, so a rule that never
//! matched cannot make every row above pass by failing closed for a different reason.
