//! An oversized request body must be refused before it is buffered, and before a model call.
//!
//! `hyper::body::Incoming` has no default limit. `req.into_body().collect()` therefore buffered
//! whatever the peer chose to send, from an unauthenticated `POST` to a port that IPP clients
//! try by default. This server keeps no job store and never looks past the 8-byte header, so
//! there is nothing a large body could be needed for.
//!
//! The second half is the part worth a test of its own: the old code turned a body read failure
//! into `Bytes::new()`, which `parse_ipp_header` reports as the operation `Empty`. The model
//! would then have been asked to answer a request nobody sent — the truncated-body-looks-like-a
//! -complete-one shape `http_common::BodyTooLarge` exists to avoid. So this asserts **zero**
//! `ipp_request_received` calls, not merely that the status is 413.
//!
//! The refusal is expressed twice, deliberately. HTTP 413 is what a generic client sees; the
//! body carries `client-error-request-entity-too-large` (0x0408) so an IPP client that only
//! reads the IPP layer learns the same thing rather than reporting a truncated response.
//!
//! **Expressing it twice is worth nothing if the peer never reads it**, which is what the third
//! test here is about. A server that answers 413 and closes while the peer is still writing
//! sends `RST` — closing a socket with unread data in the receive queue discards the response
//! bytes already written along with it — so the peer's `write` fails with `ECONNRESET` and it
//! sees a connection error where a refusal was sent. That was this suite's own intermittent
//! failure: the first test raced, passing whenever the 9 MiB write happened to fit in the
//! socket buffers and failing when it did not. The server now drains, boundedly, before
//! answering (`LINGER_DRAIN_BYTES`).
