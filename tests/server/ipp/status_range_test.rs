//! A model-supplied `http_status` narrowed with `as u16` became a 200.
//!
//! `65736 as u16` is `200`. IPP rides on HTTP, and a CUPS-style client decides whether it has
//! a printer at all from the HTTP status before it ever looks at the IPP status inside — so
//! the wrap turned every refusal the model could express at that layer into an acceptance.
//!
//! `ipp_response` accepts the field under either `http_status` or `status`, so both spellings
//! are checked. Out of range is refused rather than clamped: 599 is not what the model asked
//! for either, and the message is what the repair loop reads.
