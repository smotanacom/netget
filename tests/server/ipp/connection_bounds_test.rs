//! The connection cap on a real, running IPP server, driven from the wire.
//!
//! An IPP connection is worth more than most in this tree: `MAX_IPP_BODY_BYTES` is 8 MiB of
//! print job the server will buffer for one peer. That is a per-connection bound, and until
//! September 2026 nothing multiplied it by a finite number — this accept loop admitted every
//! connection offered to it, pre-authentication.
//!
//! Three claims, and the second is the interesting one:
//!
//! 1. `MAX_CONNECTIONS` peers are admitted.
//! 2. The next one is refused with **HTTP 503 + `Retry-After`**, not with an IPP status. IPP has
//!    `server-error-busy` (0x0507) of its own, but every IPP status rides in an
//!    `application/ipp` body answering a specific operation and echoing that operation's
//!    `request-id` — and a peer over the cap has not sent an operation, so there is no
//!    request-id to echo and nothing to say `server-error-busy` *about*. CUPS reads the version,
//!    operation and request-id back out and would report a protocol error rather than backing
//!    off. RFC 8010 makes HTTP the transport, so 503 is inside the protocol.
//! 3. Closing an admitted connection **frees exactly one slot**. A permit dropped before the
//!    connection ends un-caps the server silently; one never released wedges it shut after
//!    `MAX_CONNECTIONS` peers have ever connected.
//!
//! **How this was proved to fail without the cap**: replace the `accept_bounded` call in
//! `src/server/ipp/mod.rs` with a bare `listener.accept().await` (and drop the permit from the
//! connection task). The over-cap peer is then handed to hyper, which answers nothing until a
//! request arrives — so the `read_to_end` times out and the test fails on "was neither answered
//! nor closed".
//!
//! Loopback only.
//!
//! Run with:
//!   ./cargo-isolated.sh test --no-default-features --features ipp --test server -- ipp::connection_bounds --test-threads=100
