//! A model-supplied attribute number narrowed with `as i32` went out as a different number.
//!
//! The sibling of `status_range_test.rs`, one layer down. `http_status` was the code the model
//! *chose*; this is every integer it puts in an attribute group — `job-id`, `job-k-octets`,
//! `printer-up-time`, `queued-job-count` — and the encoder read them with
//! `n.as_i64().unwrap_or(0) as i32`.
//!
//! `4294967296 as i32` is **0**, and `job-id: 0` is not a job the model was talking about; the
//! client reads a well-formed response about a different job and has no way to know. There is
//! no wrapping variant here that flips a refusal into a success the way LDAP's `256 as u8 → 0`
//! did, but the silence is the same and so is the fix: refuse while the original value is still
//! visible, because after the cast there is nothing left to check.
//!
//! A non-integral number is refused for a related reason — IPP's `integer` syntax has no
//! fractional form, and `as_i64().unwrap_or(0)` turned `1.5` into `0` rather than saying so.
//!
//! The length bound is the same class in the other direction: IPP's `value-length` is two
//! bytes, and the encoder clamped to `u16::MAX` and wrote a message *declaring* the truncated
//! length. Self-consistent, parseable, and not what the model said.
