//! The BitTorrent tracker against a real, independent third-party client: **aria2c 1.37.0**.
//!
//! # Why this test exists
//!
//! Every other test in this directory drives the tracker with `reqwest` or a raw `TcpStream`
//! and decodes the reply with `serde_bencode` — which is the crate the *server* encodes with.
//! `metadata().e2e_testing` said so in as many words: that is one crate round-tripping through
//! itself, plus an independent *reading* of BEP 3, and it is the `rss`-before-`feed-rs`
//! situation. It proves the tracker answers; it cannot prove a real BitTorrent client can use
//! the answer.
//!
//! aria2 is a C++ BitTorrent implementation that has never seen this repository. It builds its
//! own announce URL, and — the part that matters — it must decode our **compact** peer list:
//! a bencode byte string carrying six bytes per peer, four for the IPv4 address and two for a
//! big-endian port. Nothing in that encoding is self-describing, so a wrong byte order, a wrong
//! stride or a bencode length that disagrees with the payload produces either no peers or the
//! wrong ones. The test asserts aria2 dialled the exact two peers the tracker named.
//!
//! # Not circular
//!
//! The server hand-rolls its HTTP (a raw `TcpListener`, `parse_http_request` in
//! `src/server/torrent_tracker/mod.rs`) and builds its bodies with `serde_bencode`. aria2 is an
//! unrelated binary on `PATH` that links neither. Nothing is shared between the two sides.
//!
//! # What aria2 pins that a hand-written client cannot
//!
//! `compact=1` is **hardcoded** in aria2's announce format string — it never asks for the
//! dictionary form. So the first test below exercises the compact encoder specifically, which
//! is the branch a real swarm always takes and which no existing test drives against a real
//! client. The second test asserts aria2's own parse of a `failure reason` dict, which it
//! prints verbatim.
