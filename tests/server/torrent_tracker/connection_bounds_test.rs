//! The connection cap on a real, running BitTorrent tracker, driven from the wire.
//!
//! A tracker is the most openly-addressed thing in a swarm: its address is in every `.torrent`
//! file, so every peer in the world that has the file knows where to find it.
//! `REQUEST_READ_TIMEOUT` bounds how long *one* connected-but-silent peer holds a socket, a task
//! and an `AppState` row; until September 2026 nothing bounded how many of them there could be.
//!
//! Three claims, and the second is where the vocabulary question lands:
//!
//! 1. `MAX_CONNECTIONS` peers are admitted.
//! 2. The next one is refused with **HTTP 503 + `Retry-After`**, carrying a bencoded
//!    `failure reason` — the same shape `write_failure_response` already sends when the model
//!    backend is saturated. The status code is the part that does the work, because a peer over
//!    the cap has not sent its announce: the refusal belongs to the transport rather than to a
//!    request nobody read. The bencoded body is there so a client that parses the body anyway
//!    gets a sentence instead of nothing.
//! 3. Closing an admitted connection **frees exactly one slot**. A permit dropped before the
//!    connection ends un-caps the tracker silently; one never released wedges it shut after
//!    `MAX_CONNECTIONS` peers have ever connected.
//!
//! **How this was proved to fail without the cap**: replace the `accept_bounded` call in
//! `src/server/torrent_tracker/mod.rs` with a bare `listener.accept().await` (and drop the
//! permit from the connection task). The over-cap peer is then admitted and, having sent no
//! announce, is answered with nothing — so the `read_to_end` times out and the test fails on
//! "was neither answered nor closed".
//!
//! Loopback only.
//!
//! Run with:
//!   ./cargo-isolated.sh test --no-default-features --features torrent-tracker --test server -- torrent_tracker::connection_bounds --test-threads=100
