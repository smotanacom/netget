//! What a BitTorrent client gets when the LLM backend fails.
//!
//! An announce is a request/response exchange: the client waits for a peer list, retries, and
//! eventually marks the tracker dead. Silence is therefore a stall rather than a "not me",
//! and until this pass the answer was a bare
//! `HTTP/1.1 500 Internal Server Error\r\n\r\n` — no `Content-Length`, no
//! `Connection: close`, no body, and no way for a client to tell "come back later" from
//! "this tracker is broken".
//!
//! The failure is forced by configuring a mock for the *startup* instruction only. The
//! `tracker_announce_request` event then matches no rule, the mock Ollama server answers HTTP
//! 500, and `call_llm` returns `Err` — the same shape as a real backend outage.
//!
//! Three things are asserted, and each is a separate defect if it regresses:
//!
//! 1. A **complete** HTTP response arrives, with a `Content-Length` and `Connection: close`.
//! 2. Its body is a bencoded `failure reason` — the one refusal BEP 3 defines and the only
//!    thing a BitTorrent client displays.
//! 3. That text carries **nothing** from the error: no backend URL, no model name, no path,
//!    no `anyhow` chain. It is the fixed `WireFailure` category.
