//! A model-supplied `status_code` on `npm_error` narrowed with `as u16` became a 200.
//!
//! `65736 as u16` is `200`. `npm_error` is the only way the model can refuse a registry
//! request, so the single field carrying that refusal arrived at the npm CLI as a success —
//! with a body that is an error object rather than a packument. Fail-open by arithmetic.
//!
//! Out of range is refused rather than clamped, and the message names the range so the repair
//! loop can correct the call.
