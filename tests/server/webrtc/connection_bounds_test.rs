//! The connection cap and the idle bound on a real, running WebRTC server, driven from the
//! wire. The idle tests are described where they start, below the cap test.
//!
//! `SIGNALLING_HANDSHAKE_TIMEOUT` (10s) bounds how long *one* peer holds a socket before it has
//! upgraded, and `max_peers` bounds how many *offers* are accepted — but `max_peers` counts
//! peers that have already upgraded, sent an SDP offer and been approved by a handler, so a
//! stranger who merely connects is nowhere near it. Until September 2026 nothing bounded the
//! number of pre-admission signalling connections at all, which is the population an attacker
//! actually controls.
//!
//! Three claims:
//!
//! 1. `MAX_CONNECTIONS` peers are admitted, each completing a real RFC 6455 upgrade.
//!    Handshaking them rather than leaving them silent is what keeps claim 3 honest: a peer
//!    that only opens a socket is evicted by `SIGNALLING_HANDSHAKE_TIMEOUT` after ten seconds, which would
//!    free slots on its own and let the slot-return assertion pass for a reason that has
//!    nothing to do with the permit.
//! 2. The next one is refused with `HTTP/1.1 503` and `Retry-After`. This server's own refusal for a peer over
//!    `max_peers` is a `Rejected` signalling frame, and it is unreachable here: that is a
//!    WebSocket text message, and a peer refused at the accept has not upgraded, so it has no
//!    frame parser running. What it *is* in the middle of is an ordinary HTTP/1.1 GET
//!    (RFC 6455 §4.1), so 503 is inside the protocol rather than beside it.
//! 3. Closing an admitted connection **frees exactly one slot**. A permit dropped before the
//!    connection ends un-caps the server silently; one never released wedges it shut after
//!    `MAX_CONNECTIONS` peers have ever connected. The connection task here spawns a writer,
//!    but `.await`s it on its only exit path, so the single permit it holds covers both.
//!
//! **How this was proved to fail without the cap**: replace the `accept_bounded` call in
//! `src/server/webrtc/mod.rs` with a bare `listener.accept().await` (and drop the permit from
//! the connection task). The over-cap peer is then upgraded and the test fails on reading 101
//! where it demanded 503.
//!
//! The server is model-free: an empty instruction really is model-free, where `None` is
//! replaced by a default one. The WebSocket upgrade itself consults nothing, and no signalling
//! frame is ever sent, so 256 connections cost no model calls at all. Loopback only.
//!
//! Run with:
//!   ./cargo-isolated.sh test --no-default-features --features webrtc --test server -- webrtc::connection_bounds --test-threads=100
