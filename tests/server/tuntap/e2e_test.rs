//! The TUN/TAP pipeline, end to end, without root.
//!
//! Creating a TUN interface needs root on every platform, so the transport cannot run here.
//! The pipeline can: `TunTapEngine::spawn_over_channels` runs the *same* `run()` the real
//! device calls, with the file descriptor replaced by a pair of `mpsc` ends. Frames go in one
//! side, the decision path runs in full — decode, filter, event handlers, escalation budget,
//! the model, action execution — and whatever NetGet decided to write comes out the other.
//!
//! **The important test in this file is `the_escalation_bound_holds_under_a_flood`.** The
//! design problem this protocol exists to solve is that a per-packet LLM call is unusable, so
//! the claim that only a bounded few packets ever reach the model has to be *measured*, not
//! asserted in a comment. It is measured the way `tests/empty_static_handler_test.rs` measures
//! its claim: point NetGet at a mock model that records every call, flood it, and count.
//!
//! A zero on its own would prove nothing — the mock might simply be unreachable — so
//! `the_model_is_consulted_when_nothing_else_answers` is the negative control and must be
//! non-zero. Read them together or neither means anything.
//!
//! Run with:
//!   ./cargo-isolated.sh test --no-default-features --features tuntap \
//!       --test server::tuntap::e2e_test -- --test-threads=100
