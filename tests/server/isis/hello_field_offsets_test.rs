//! The LAN Hello field layout, against ISO/IEC 10589 rather than against itself.
//!
//! `build_isis_hello` wrote the PDU-length field at offset **15**, which is the *holding
//! time*. Counting the fields the function actually pushes gives the spec layout:
//!
//! ```text
//!   0..8   common header
//!   8      circuit type
//!   9..15  source ID (6)
//!   15..17 holding time (2)
//!   17..19 PDU length (2)
//!   19     priority        (LAN only)
//!   20..27 LAN ID (7)      (LAN only)
//! ```
//!
//! So every Hello this server emitted carried the PDU length *in place of* the holding time,
//! and left the real length field as zeros. A receiver reads holding time as the adjacency
//! hold timer, so it got whatever the packet happened to be long — and read the length as 0.
//!
//! Nothing caught it because no test asserted a field offset: the e2e suite drives the server
//! and checks it emits *something*, and the codec that would disagree is the same code.
//!
//! Run with:
//!   ./cargo-isolated.sh test --no-default-features --features isis --test server -- isis::hello_field
