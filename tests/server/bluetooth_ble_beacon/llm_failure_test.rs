//! What happens to a BLE beacon when the LLM backend fails: nothing goes on air, loudly.
//!
//! A beacon has no peer to answer. It accepts no connections, exposes no characteristics and
//! reads nothing back, so there is no error response to send — the only observable behaviour is
//! whether a frame is transmitted and what the operator is told. That makes "fail closed" here
//! mean exactly one thing: **no advertisement, and `ServerStatus::Error` rather than `Running`.**
//!
//! This is deliberately the opposite of the base `bluetooth-ble` stack, which keeps a powered
//! adapter up when its startup call fails, because a GATT server's model answers *traffic*. A
//! beacon has no traffic: the single `beacon_started` call *is* the whole server. A beacon
//! sitting in `Running` with nothing on air is indistinguishable, to anyone reading
//! `list_servers`, from one that is broadcasting — which is the fail-open shape the root
//! CLAUDE.md warns about. So `spawn` returns `Err`, `server_startup` records the reason, and
//! `remove_server` drops the live handle, taking the `bluer` advertisement with it.
//!
//! # What can be asserted where
//!
//! On macOS and Windows `spawn` refuses *before* the model call (see `e2e_test.rs`), so the
//! failure path below is unreachable off Linux and the message helper is tested directly. The
//! Linux end-to-end check is `#[ignore]`d for the same reason as the one in `e2e_test.rs`: it
//! needs `bluetoothd` and an adapter.
