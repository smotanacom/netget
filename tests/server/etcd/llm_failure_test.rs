//! What an etcd client gets when the LLM backend fails: a non-zero gRPC status, and which one.
//!
//! etcd already answered on this path — it never went silent — so what is under test here is the
//! *choice of code*. Every handler failure was reported as `13 INTERNAL`, including the ones
//! caused by the LLM rate limiter refusing a request because the backend was saturated.
//! `INTERNAL` is explicitly **not** in gRPC's retryable set and is not a code any
//! `grpc-service-config` `retryableStatusCodes` list names, so a backlog that would clear in
//! seconds was handed to every caller as a permanent application error. For etcd that is worse
//! than it sounds: a `Txn`-based distributed lock reports a hard failure rather than a retryable
//! one, and the client gives up.
//!
//! Two things are asserted, and they need different techniques:
//!
//! * **On the wire**, that a plain backend failure really produces `grpc-status: 13` with an
//!   empty body, decoded from the HTTP/2 response headers rather than through a client library
//!   that might synthesise a status of its own. The request is a hand-built protobuf
//!   `RangeRequest` so nothing in this file shares code with the server's own encoder.
//! * **In the classifier**, that an overload maps to `14 UNAVAILABLE` while anything else stays
//!   `13 INTERNAL`. This half cannot be driven end-to-end: the only errors
//!   `crate::llm::is_overload_error` recognises come from the rate limiter, whose bounds are set
//!   by `--llm-queue-timeout` / `--llm-max-queued`, and `tests/helpers/netget.rs` passes neither
//!   (it passes only `--llm-max-concurrent`, at 1000). Reaching `QueueFull` through the harness
//!   would need 129 requests in flight against a mock that answers instantly. So the
//!   classification is exercised directly instead of being faked with an assertion that proves
//!   nothing.
