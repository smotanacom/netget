//! The real `etcdctl` binary, which is grpc-go, against NetGet's etcd server.
//!
//! # Why this test exists, and why it could not be written before
//!
//! Every other test in this directory drives `etcd_client`, which is tonic. Tonic accepts a
//! `grpc-status` sitting in the *initial* HEADERS beside a DATA body; the gRPC specification
//! does not, and grpc-go does not either. So the entire suite passed while `etcdctl` could not
//! complete one RPC:
//!
//! ```text
//! Error: rpc error: code = Internal desc = server closed the stream without sending trailers
//! ```
//!
//! That is the `mysql`/`mysql_async` shape the project CLAUDE.md records — a maturity rating
//! resting on one lenient client agreeing with one bug. A second, stricter implementation is
//! the only thing that finds it, which is what this file is.
//!
//! It was deliberately **not** committed while the bug was live. A test written against broken
//! behaviour locks the behaviour in.
//!
//! # What it proves
//!
//! `etcdctl` is a full gRPC client: it negotiates HTTP/2, sends a length-prefixed protobuf
//! message, and refuses any stream that does not end in a trailing HEADERS frame carrying
//! `grpc-status`. Four commands cover the three KV verbs plus the repeated-field path:
//!
//! | command | exercises |
//! |---|---|
//! | `put` | trailers after a DATA frame — the case that was broken |
//! | `get` | Range with one pair, and the `key\nvalue` output shape |
//! | `get --prefix` | Range with `range_end` set and three pairs, so repeated fields are real |
//! | `del` | DeleteRange, whose count the handler decides |
//!
//! Everything binds to 127.0.0.1 and no real etcd cluster is contacted.
