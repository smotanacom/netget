//! A handler that produces no response action must not answer the client anyway.
//!
//! `handle_put` already refused this case. `handle_range` and `handle_delete_range` did not, and
//! what they returned instead was not a vague or empty reply — it was a **definite, successful
//! answer**:
//!
//! * A `RangeResponse` with `kvs: []` and `count: 0` means "that key does not exist". A client
//!   cannot tell it apart from a real lookup that found nothing, so a model that declined to
//!   answer, a static handler with an empty action list, or a reply whose actions were all
//!   unrecognised silently asserted the absence of a key.
//! * A `DeleteRangeResponse` with `deleted: 0` under a freshly *incremented* revision means the
//!   delete ran and committed, matching nothing.
//!
//! Both are the fail-open shape the root CLAUDE.md names as the most dangerous pattern in this
//! codebase, wearing the clothes of a normal result. The responses are decoded from the HTTP/2
//! headers by hand so nothing here shares code with the server's encoder, and the requests are
//! hand-built protobuf for the same reason.
