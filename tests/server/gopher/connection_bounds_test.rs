//! The connection cap on a real, running Gopher server, driven from the wire.
//!
//! `SELECTOR_READ_TIMEOUT` bounds how long *one* connected-but-silent peer holds a socket, a
//! task and an `AppState` row. It says nothing about how many such peers there can be at once,
//! and until September 2026 this accept loop admitted every connection offered to it.
//!
//! Three claims, and the third is the one that catches the subtle bug:
//!
//! 1. `MAX_CONNECTIONS` peers are admitted.
//! 2. The next one is refused with a **type-3 error item** — RFC 1436's own way of saying "this
//!    did not work", and the same shape `gopher_error_item` writes for every other refusal here
//!    — followed by the `.` terminator and EOF. A menu client renders it as an error line;
//!    `curl`, which reads until EOF, prints it and exits 0 rather than 28.
//! 3. Closing an admitted connection **frees exactly one slot**. A permit dropped before the
//!    connection ends un-caps the server silently; one never released wedges it shut after
//!    `MAX_CONNECTIONS` peers have ever connected.
//!
//! **How this was proved to fail without the cap**: replace the `accept_bounded` call in
//! `src/server/gopher/mod.rs` with a bare `listener.accept().await` (and drop the permit from
//! the connection task). The test then reads nothing from the over-cap peer and fails on the
//! refusal assertion.
//!
//! The server is model-free: an empty instruction really is model-free, where `None` is replaced
//! by a default one. Gopher is client-speaks-first, so a silent peer provokes no model call.
//! Loopback only.
//!
//! Run with:
//!   ./cargo-isolated.sh test --no-default-features --features gopher --test server -- gopher::connection_bounds --test-threads=100
