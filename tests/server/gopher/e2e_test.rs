//! End-to-end Gopher (RFC 1436) tests.
//!
//! Two of the five tests drive the real `curl(1)` binary, and they are what the `Beta` rating
//! rests on: a raw socket only proves bytes arrived, whereas curl fetching the URL and exiting
//! 0 proves the framing, the CRLF endings and — critically — the **close** are acceptable to an
//! independent implementation. curl reads a Gopher reply until EOF, so a server that does not
//! hang up leaves it hanging until `--max-time` and exiting 28.
//!
//! Both curl tests **hard-fail** when curl is absent or lacks gopher support. They do not skip:
//! a skip-when-missing gate is a silent pass on any runner without the binary, which would
//! leave this protocol's maturity rating resting on nothing.
//!
//! Four facts about `curl`'s gopher support, measured rather than assumed, that shape these
//! tests:
//!
//! - **curl strips the item-type character from the URL path.** `gopher://h/1/menu` and
//!   `gopher://h/0/menu` both put the selector `/menu` on the wire; `gopher://h/` sends an
//!   empty selector and `gopher://h/1/` sends `/`. The type in a Gopher URL describes the
//!   reply the caller expects — the server never sees it — so curl cannot be used to test
//!   anything type-dependent on the request side.
//! - **curl does no Gopher-level parsing at all.** The reply reaches stdout verbatim: the
//!   terminating `.` line is still there, and doubled leading dots are *not* undone. So the
//!   escaping and the terminator are asserted here as literal bytes in curl's output.
//! - **A type-3 error item is still exit 0.** curl has no concept of a Gopher error, so an
//!   error reply must be asserted on stdout, never on the exit status.
//! - **`%09` in the URL becomes a real tab**, which is how a type-7 search request is spelled.
