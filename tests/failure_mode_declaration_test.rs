//! A server's behaviour on LLM failure must be **declared**, not described in prose.
//!
//! The root `CLAUDE.md` carried a list of ~20 "deliberately silent" protocols. That list was
//! wrong in both directions when it was audited: NDP logged its own *transmit* failure as
//! `decision=model_silent`, so `grep decision=fail_closed_` found nothing for a real outage;
//! `radius`, `stun` and five BLE profiles were on it while answering on the wire (Access-Reject,
//! a Binding Success, ATT Unlikely Error); and fifteen servers that really were silent — the L2
//! announcement family, the discovery responders, `icmp`, `wol`, `rawip`, `tuntap` — were on no
//! list at all. A paragraph in a shared document cannot be checked against 140 servers. A
//! `FailureMode` on the metadata can.
//!
//! The distinction is not stylistic. It turns on one question: **is every reply this protocol
//! can send a positive assertion?** `openvpn` is the case to remember — its only pre-TLS server
//! message is `P_CONTROL_HARD_RESET_SERVER_V2`, and sending it *is* admitting the peer, so
//! "fixing the silence" there would convert a backend outage into an authentication bypass.
//! Where the answer is no — HTTP has a 503, RESP has `-LOADING`, DHCPv6 has UnspecFail, NBNS has
//! SRV_ERR — silence merely makes the peer wait out its own timeout, and answering is strictly
//! better. That is why `FailureMode::Answers` is the default: the August 2026 sweep found 64 of
//! 135 servers silent when they should have answered.
//!
//! # What this file enforces
//!
//! 1. Every protocol documented here as silent declares `.deliberately_silent()`.
//! 2. Every protocol documented here as answering does **not** declare it, and declares
//!    `.answers_on_failure()`.
//! 3. **Every connectionless server declares one or the other explicitly.** This is the rule
//!    that would have found the fifteen, and the reason it is scoped to connectionless servers
//!    is where silence comes from. On a datagram protocol there is no connection to close, so a
//!    failure arm that writes nothing produces silence *by default*, and the default
//!    `FailureMode::Answers` cannot tell "someone wrote the answer" from "nobody looked". On a
//!    connection protocol the same arm at least ends in a close the peer can see. All fifteen
//!    undeclared-silent servers were connectionless, as were all eleven in the old baseline
//!    except the BLE and USB families, which are covered by (1) and (2).
//! 4. A silent protocol still logs a `fail_closed_` decision token, because the log is the only
//!    place the distinction survives.
//!
//! # Why not detect a silent failure arm directly
//!
//! It was tried, and it is not conservative in either direction. The obvious mechanical rule —
//! find the `Err` arm after a `call_llm`, and flag it when it writes nothing — cannot be written
//! by reading source: half the servers route the outcome through a `decide()` helper that
//! returns bytes to a caller that writes them, so the arm itself never writes even when the
//! server answers. A phrase heuristic (a `fail_closed_llm_error` log line whose string says
//! "nothing sent" / "no reply" / "no advertisement") was measured against the unfixed tree: it
//! found 9 of the 15 undeclared-silent servers and flagged `ident`, `m3ua` and `usb/fido2`,
//! which all answer (an IDENT `ERROR`, an M3UA observational event that defines no reply, a
//! CTAP2 `OPERATION_DENIED`). A build-failing check that misses a third of its targets and
//! invents three more trains people to edit the baseline. Rule 3 asks for a *decision* instead,
//! which a reader can check in one line and a scan can check exactly.
