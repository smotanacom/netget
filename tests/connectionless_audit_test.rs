//! Every UDP-serving protocol must declare `.connectionless()` in its metadata.
//!
//! `AppState::cleanup_old_connections` — the 10-second idle sweep ticked by the TUI
//! and the MCP loop — only reaps connection entries for servers whose
//! `ProtocolMetadataV2::connectionless` is set. That is deliberate: UDP/raw servers
//! track one bookkeeping entry per remote address and nothing ever closes them, so
//! the sweep is the only thing standing between an idle UDP server and an
//! ever-growing connection map. (The old behaviour — sweeping *every* server — was
//! the dangerous direction: it evicted live TCP-style connections mid-conversation.
//! See the root CLAUDE.md, "The 10-second idle sweep".)
//!
//! A new UDP protocol that forgets the flag therefore leaks idle entries until its
//! server stops, and nothing at runtime says so. This audit closes that gap the
//! same way `event_action_declarations_test` closes its own: walk the registry and
//! check every registered protocol at build time.
//!
//! The UDP-ness of a protocol is read from its **source on disk**: if any `.rs`
//! file under `src/server/<dir>/` mentions `UdpSocket` (the `tokio::net` one and
//! the `std::net` one both mean datagram handling; `create_reusable_udp_socket`
//! from `socket_helpers` is matched too, in case a protocol adopts the helper
//! without naming the type), the protocol serves datagrams and must declare
//! `.connectionless()`. Declaring it *without* using `UdpSocket` is fine — `isis`
//! does, legitimately: raw link-level frames have per-remote entries with exactly
//! the same nothing-ever-closes-them shape.
//!
//! Like every registry-walking audit, this covers only the protocols compiled into
//! the current feature set; the `registry-audit` CI job runs the audits at
//! `--all-features` for that reason.
