//! Ten thousand short connections, and what must not grow.
//!
//! `PROTOCOL_QUALITY.md` Tier 2: *"A soak test per protocol family. Ten thousand short
//! connections against a running server; assert `AppState` connection count returns to zero and
//! RSS is flat."*
//!
//! # Why this exists now
//!
//! 145 `tokio::spawn` sites across 113 protocols were converted to `AppState::spawn_server_task`
//! on 15 September 2026, so that `stop_server` can abort a per-connection task. That registration
//! is `tasks.retain(|h| !h.is_finished()); tasks.push(handle)` — it prunes **on the next
//! registration**, which means the steady state is one entry per *live* connection however many
//! have come and gone. That is a claim about the tenth thousandth connection, and nothing in the
//! tree tested past the thirty-first (`per_connection_registration_does_not_accumulate_handles`).
//!
//! The opposite — a server that accumulates a `JoinHandle`, a `ConnectionState` or a peer handle
//! for every connection it has *ever* accepted — is invisible until a long-running server falls
//! over, because every individual test opens a handful of connections and stops.
//!
//! # What is asserted, and why each one is here
//!
//! | assertion | the leak it catches |
//! |---|---|
//! | the tracked-connection map does not grow with connections served | a server that never forgets a closed peer — state grows forever and the dashboard paints peers that are gone. A leaking server grows this at 1.0 entries per connection; the budget is 0.2 |
//! | `server_task_count` never exceeds a bound set by live connections | the `retain`-on-register pruning in `register_server_task` not actually pruning |
//! | RSS is flat across the run | everything the two counters above cannot see — buffers, peer handles, access-log rows, channel backlog |
//! | active connection count returns to **zero** once traffic stops | a close path that marks some connections and misses others |
//! | `connections` is empty after `cleanup_closed_connections` | `Closed` entries that are marked and never drained |
//! | `recent_connections` stays at its declared cap | the "recently connected" ring growing without bound |
//! | the listening port is free after stop, and rebinds | a stopped server holding its socket |
//!
//! # The reaper is part of the system under test
//!
//! `AppState` does not delete a closed connection; it marks it `Closed` and leaves it for the
//! cleanup tick, which the TUI event loop and the MCP reaper each drive every few seconds with a
//! ten-second retention. Nothing drives one inside a test process.
//!
//! A first version of this file left it that way, and all three stream protocols grew the
//! connection map at **exactly 1.0 entries per connection served** and RSS by about **1.4 KB per
//! connection** — 34 MiB to 48 MiB over ten thousand HTTP connections. That is not a leak. It is
//! the retention window with nothing reaping it, and calling it a leak would have been the
//! `ospf` mistake in a new place: a test measuring a configuration NetGet never ships.
//!
//! So the harness runs the reaper at the production values ([`CONNECTION_RETENTION_SECS`]) and
//! the soak is paced to outlast it, which turns the question into the one worth asking — does the
//! map reach a **steady state**, or does it track the total ever served? Measured: a steady
//! ~4 120 entries, which is [`TARGET_CONNECTIONS_PER_SEC`] × [`CONNECTION_RETENTION_SECS`], flat
//! from the first sweep to the ten thousandth connection.
//!
//! **The finding worth keeping is that the unreaped number is 1.0.** Between two cleanup ticks a
//! busy server holds one entry for every connection in that window, and every one of those
//! entries is under the single global `AppState` `RwLock`. Nothing bounds it but the tick.
//!
//! # Honesty about RSS
//!
//! Allocators do not return freed pages promptly, and a process that has just started has not
//! finished growing its arenas, so **start-vs-end is not a measurement** — it reports growth that
//! would have happened with no traffic at all. This compares a *late* window against an *earlier*
//! one, both taken after a warm-up of [`RSS_WARMUP`] connections, and states the growth as
//! **bytes per connection** rather than as a percentage. A percentage is the wrong unit: 5% of a
//! 200 MiB process is 10 MiB, which is a 1 KB-per-connection leak waved through.
//!
//! RSS also steps rather than sloping, so a rate alone is not enough either — see
//! [`MIN_RSS_GROWTH_BYTES`], which documents both the second half of the rule and the real
//! sensitivity it buys. In short: the two counters are the sharp instruments and RSS is the
//! backstop for what they cannot count.
//!
//! Every sample is printed on failure, so a red run says *where* the curve bent rather than only
//! that it did.
//!
//! # Why these four protocols
//!
//! One per shape, not one per protocol — the leak is in the shared lifecycle, and the shapes
//! differ in who owns the socket:
//!
//! * **`tcp`** — a plain stream server whose reader NetGet wrote itself. The reference
//!   implementation every other stream protocol was copied from.
//! * **`http`** — hyper's `serve_connection` owns the connection, so NetGet's tracking and the
//!   library's lifetime have to agree. `CLAUDE.md` records this as the shape ~30 protocols share.
//! * **`dns`** — datagram, and declared `.connectionless()`. It adds a **new** connection entry
//!   per *datagram*, with no close path at all, so its entire defence against unbounded growth is
//!   the 10-second idle sweep. That sweep is the thing under test here, and it is the one
//!   protocol family where "returns to zero" is a statement about the reaper rather than about
//!   the close path.
//! * **`redis`** — a session protocol with its own framing and per-connection state machine.
//!
//! # Not in the normal suite, and why
//!
//! Every test here is `#[ignore]`d with a reason. Each takes ~25 seconds by construction — it has
//! to outlast the retention window — and the four together run in about 100 seconds, which is
//! several times the whole rest of the suite.
//!
//! The part that would make them actively harmful as a default is the ephemeral port range. Each
//! clean close leaves the side that sent `FIN` first — the test — in `TIME_WAIT` for 2·MSL, and
//! macOS reports 16 384 ephemeral ports against a 15-second MSL. Two of these running
//! concurrently under `--test-threads=100` exhaust the range and report `EADDRNOTAVAIL`, which is
//! a kernel bookkeeping limit wearing a leak's clothes. They must run **serially**, which is what
//! `.github/workflows/nightly-soak.yml` does.
//!
//! Run them by hand with:
//!
//! ```text
//! CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/tmp/vsoak ./cargo-isolated.sh test \
//!     --no-default-features --features tcp,http,dns,redis \
//!     --test connection_soak_test -- --ignored --test-threads=1 --nocapture
