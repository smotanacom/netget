//! Every file path a protocol's `CLAUDE.md` names in backticks must exist.
//!
//! The root `CLAUDE.md` warns that the per-protocol docs "are frequently more aspirational than
//! the code". The most expensive shape of that is **fiction**: a doc that describes files,
//! suites and test cases which were never written. It reads exactly like a doc that describes
//! something real, and nothing in the tree disagrees with it, so the next person plans around
//! it. `tests/server/bluetooth_ble_remote/CLAUDE.md` described three btleplug test cases with
//! per-test LLM budgets and an explanation of why they were `#[ignore]`d; none of the three
//! existed. `src/client/smtp/CLAUDE.md` gave the full call signature of a
//! `SmtpClient::send_email` that has no definition.
//!
//! A path is the one part of that prose a machine can settle. This test walks every
//! `src/**/CLAUDE.md` and `tests/**/CLAUDE.md`, takes every backticked span that looks like a
//! path into this repository, and requires it to resolve on disk.
//!
//! # What counts as a path, and why the rule is this narrow
//!
//! The rule is deliberately conservative, because a build-failing check with false positives
//! teaches people to edit the baseline instead of the code — the lesson the root `CLAUDE.md`
//! draws from the strict version of the startup-parameter scan. A span is a candidate only if
//! it contains a `/`, ends in a known source extension, has no whitespace, no glob or
//! `<placeholder>` metacharacter, no URL scheme, and is not absolute. Every one of those
//! exclusions was measured against the tree rather than guessed:
//!
//! - **No `/` ⇒ not checked.** 1321 spans are bare filenames (`server_startup.rs`,
//!   `e2e_test.rs`, `actions.rs`). They are usually shorthand for a file the reader already has
//!   open, and there are 137 different `actions.rs`, so "does it exist" has no useful answer.
//! - **Absolute paths are skipped.** `/jwks.json`, `/about.txt` and `/readme.txt` are HTTP
//!   request targets and served-file names, not files in this tree, and `/etc/docker/daemon.json`
//!   belongs to the machine.
//! - **A scheme is skipped.** `smb://fileserver/documents/readme.txt` is a URL.
//! - **A suffix resolves.** `cli/client_startup.rs`, `state/server.rs` and `server/peer_support.rs`
//!   are how this repo habitually cites a file, and all three name something real. Requiring the
//!   full repo-relative spelling would flag 26 correct citations, so a candidate resolves if it
//!   is a component-aligned suffix of any file in the tree.
//! - **Directories are not checked.** The one non-URL directory span that fails to resolve is
//!   `src/client/eapol/` in `src/server/eapol/CLAUDE.md`, in a sentence whose point is that
//!   there *is* no such directory. A rule that fails a doc for correctly saying something is
//!   absent is worse than no rule.
//!
//! # Markdown links are checked too, and were worse
//!
//! `[text](../../X.md)` is the same claim in a different syntax, and the yield there was far
//! higher: **15 of 35** relative link targets were dead, almost all of them pointing at root
//! status reports (`TEST_INFRASTRUCTURE_FIXES.md`, `TEST_STATUS_REPORT.md`,
//! `IPSEC_RESEARCH.md`) that the root-clutter cleanup deleted. Those had zero false positives,
//! so link targets carry no exemption list: a relative link either resolves or is dead.
//!
//! # False-positive rate
//!
//! Measured over the whole tree at the time of writing: 980 backticked spans qualify as
//! candidates and 31 did not resolve. One was a `./` normalisation bug in the extractor, since
//! fixed. **14 were real drift** and were corrected in the commit before this one. The other 16
//! occurrences — 15 distinct doc/path pairs — are the single class this check cannot decide
//! from source: a path that is real, but in **another** repository. They are listed in
//! `FOREIGN_PATHS` below with the reason each is exempt, and that list is the whole
//! false-positive surface: 1.6% of candidates before naming them, zero after.
//!
//! Adding an entry to `FOREIGN_PATHS` is a claim that the path names a file in a *different*
//! codebase. It is not a way to silence a path that ought to exist here and does not.
//!
//! # What is deliberately *not* checked, and why
//!
//! A backticked Rust item (`Type::method`, `fn_name()`) was tried and rejected. Scoped to spans
//! whose type this repo defines, 587 qualify and 10 do not resolve — but 8 of those 10 are
//! correct: `Statement::set_consistency` is scylla's, `OpenAIConfig::with_api_key` is
//! async-openai's, `Message::from_vec()` is hickory-dns's, and `ImapServer::spawn_with_tls` is
//! a deliberate reference to something that *used* to exist. A source-only scan cannot resolve
//! a name against the crate that owns it, so the check would fail eight correct docs to catch
//! two — the shape the root `CLAUDE.md` warns trains people to edit the baseline instead of the
//! code. The two it did catch were found by running the measurement once, by hand, and fixed.
//!
//! Run with:
//!   ./cargo-isolated.sh test --no-default-features --features tcp --test doc_paths_exist_test
