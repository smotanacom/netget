//! The dashboard's `[ send ]` path on an OSPF client.
//!
//! OSPF needs a raw IP socket (protocol 89), which wants `CAP_NET_RAW` - the protocol's own
//! metadata declares `PrivilegeRequirement::RawSockets` accordingly. So this file is split
//! in two:
//!
//! * [`command_channel_wiring`] always runs. Without the capability the client cannot be
//!   created at all, and what it asserts is the part of the contract that failure still has
//!   to honour: `connect()` returns `Err`, **no command handle is left registered**, and a
//!   later `send_to_client` fails fast with the "does not accept injected commands" error
//!   rather than hanging. That is rule 3 of the command-channel contract, and it is exactly
//!   the case that would strand a dead `[ send ]` row in the dashboard. With the capability
//!   the same test asserts the live wiring instead: the handle is registered, an unknown
//!   verb comes back `Rejected`, and `wait_for_more` comes back `Executed`.
//! * [`injected_hello_puts_a_packet_on_the_wire`] is `#[ignore]`d because it emits a real
//!   OSPF Hello to 224.0.0.5 and therefore genuinely needs the privilege (and a
//!   multicast-capable interface).
//!
//! Zero LLM calls either way: the client's LLM points at an unreachable URL, so its
//! connected-event call - which OSPF runs in its own task - fails immediately.
//!
//! Run with:
//!   ./cargo-isolated.sh test --no-default-features --features ospf --test client -- ospf::command_channel --test-threads=100
