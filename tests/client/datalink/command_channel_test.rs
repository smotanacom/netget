//! The DataLink client's lifecycle and the dashboard's `[ send ]` path:
//! `AppState::send_to_client` injects an action from outside the client's pcap loop.
//!
//! Zero LLM calls — the client's LLM points at an unreachable URL, and the connected-event
//! turn it makes fails there without touching anything asserted here.
//!
//! # The split, and why it is where it is
//!
//! Raw frame injection goes through libpcap, which needs `/dev/bpf*` access on macOS/BSD or
//! root/`CAP_NET_RAW` on Linux. `connect()` now **awaits** that handle and returns `Err` when
//! it cannot be opened, so on an unprivileged host there is no live client to inject into —
//! which is the honest outcome, and is what [`datalink_client_refuses_an_interface_it_cannot_open`]
//! asserts on every host. Everything that needs a live capture is in
//! [`injected_frame_is_transmitted`], `#[ignore]`d, and it *fails loudly* rather than skipping
//! if it is run without the access it needs.
//!
//! The model-facing half — which frames `execute_action` accepts and refuses, and what the
//! event payloads look like — needs no client at all and lives in `action_test.rs`.
//!
//! Run with:
//!   ./cargo-isolated.sh test --no-default-features --features datalink --test client -- datalink::command_channel --test-threads=100
//!   # privileged half, on a host with BPF access:
//!   ./cargo-isolated.sh test --no-default-features --features datalink --test client -- datalink::command_channel --ignored
