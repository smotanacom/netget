//! A hostile SIP response must not kill the client's read loop.
//!
//! Two panics used to be reachable from the peer, and both take the worst possible shape: they
//! fire inside the `tokio::spawn`ed read loop, which swallows the panic, so the client stays
//! `Connected` in the dashboard, the log says nothing, and every later response is ignored.
//!
//! 1. **`extract_uri` sliced backwards.** It searched the whole header value for `<` and,
//!    independently, for `>`, then sliced between them. A display name containing a `>` before
//!    the angle-bracketed URI — `"ev>il" <sip:victim@host>` — put the slice's start past its
//!    end, which is an immediate panic on a `&str`. It is reached from the automatic-ACK path,
//!    i.e. from any `200` whose CSeq method is `INVITE`. **That is what this test drives.**
//!
//! 2. **The automatic ACK's `.unwrap()`s.** The same path read the dialog's Call-ID and From
//!    tag with `.unwrap()`, and both are `None` until this client has itself sent a request —
//!    so an *unsolicited* `200 OK`/`CSeq: n INVITE` panicked. There is no dialog to acknowledge
//!    in that case, so the fix logs it and sends nothing. It is **not** driven here, and the
//!    reason is a harness limit worth stating rather than hiding: the client binds an ephemeral
//!    port and `connect`s, so a test peer only learns its address once the client has spoken —
//!    and speaking is exactly what fills those two fields in. Reaching the `None` arm from the
//!    wire needs the client's local address to be recorded in `AppState`, which
//!    `cli/client_startup.rs` does not currently do.
//!
//! The peer is a plain UDP socket, so nothing depends on server behaviour, and the client's LLM
//! points at a closed port so no model is involved.
