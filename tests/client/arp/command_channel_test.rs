//! The dashboard's `[ send ]` path on an ARP client, and the startup contract that decides
//! whether such a client exists at all.
//!
//! Zero LLM calls - the client's LLM points at an unreachable URL, so nothing here depends on
//! a model being reachable.
//!
//! # Why the unprivileged tests do not drive a live client
//!
//! ARP capture *and* injection go through libpcap, which needs root (or `/dev/bpf*` access on
//! macOS, `CAP_NET_RAW` on Linux), so no ordinary run can have a working ARP client. What is
//! covered without privilege is therefore split in two:
//!
//! * [`capture_that_never_opened_is_reported_as_an_error`] - `connect()` must return `Err`
//!   rather than reporting a `Connected` client that opened nothing. This is the client-side
//!   twin of `tests/capture_startup_reports_failure_test.rs`.
//! * [`injected_actions_the_protocol_cannot_build_are_refused`] - the rejection paths of the
//!   injected-command surface, asserted directly against `Client::execute_action`, which is
//!   the layer that actually decides them.
//!
//! The privileged half - the command handle registered before the started-event LLM call, and
//! `sendpacket` really putting 42 bytes on a wire, acknowledged back through the channel so
//! the outcome can be `Sent { bytes_sent: 42 }` - is
//! [`injected_arp_request_is_transmitted`], `#[ignore]`d because it needs root.
//!
//! Run with:
//!   ./cargo-isolated.sh test --no-default-features --features arp --test client -- arp::command_channel --test-threads=100
