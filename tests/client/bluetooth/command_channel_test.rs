//! The dashboard's `[ send ]` path on a Bluetooth LE client.
//!
//! **What this environment can and cannot check.** The BLE client needs a real adapter to start
//! at all (`Manager::adapters()` must return one), and every GATT verb additionally needs a
//! peripheral in radio range. There is no loopback BLE and no software peripheral, so the parts
//! that touch a device are `#[ignore]`d rather than faked.
//!
//! The always-running test adapts to whichever is true here:
//!
//! * No adapter — the client's connect fails and the only thing left to assert is rule 3: no
//!   stale command handle, and `send_to_client` refuses instead of hanging.
//! * An adapter — the client starts (its initial scan runs in its own task), so the injection
//!   half runs for real: an unknown verb comes back `Rejected`, and a GATT read with no
//!   peripheral connected comes back as an error naming that, never as a fake success.
//!
//! Zero LLM calls either way: the client's LLM points at `http://127.0.0.1:1`, so the scan-
//! complete call fails and the loop must tolerate it — which is the point, because the command
//! channel is registered before it.
//!
//! Run with:
//!   ./cargo-isolated.sh test --no-default-features --features bluetooth-ble-client --test client -- bluetooth::command_channel --test-threads=100
