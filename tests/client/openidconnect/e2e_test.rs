//! What happens when the configured provider is not there.
//!
//! # This file used to hold five tests that ran nowhere and named production
//!
//! Each was `#[ignore]`d with the reason written into the attribute: "No `.with_mock()`
//! configured: hits real accounts.google.com / example.com and requires `--use-ollama`." So
//! they proved nothing on any runner, and the one way to make them run was to send live
//! traffic to Google. That is the client-side shape of the defect this repo already knows
//! from the DynamoDB client — *a client that loses its target must fail, never fall back to
//! the real service* — except here it was the test, not the code, pointing at production.
//!
//! They are gone. What they claimed to cover (discovery against a provider, a real token
//! exchange, the tokens that come back) is covered for real by `command_channel_test.rs`,
//! which serves a discovery document, a JWKS and a token endpoint in-process and asserts
//! that only the provider's own token is stored.
//!
//! What is left here is the case that suite cannot show, because it always has a provider:
//! with **no** provider reachable, nothing may be invented. The `openidconnect` crate is an
//! SDK, and an SDK that cannot reach its configured endpoint is exactly where a fallback
//! would hide.
//!
//! Zero LLM calls: the client's LLM points at an unreachable URL, so its connect-time calls
//! fail and the loop tolerates it.
//!
//! Run with:
//!   ./cargo-isolated.sh test --no-default-features --features openidconnect \
//!       --test client -- openidconnect --test-threads=100
