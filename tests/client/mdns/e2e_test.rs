//! E2E tests for mDNS client
//!
//! These tests verify mDNS client functionality by spawning the actual NetGet binary
//! and testing client behavior as a black-box.
//! Test strategy: Use netget binary to start mDNS client, < 5 LLM calls total.
//!
//! Note: These tests rely on built-in mDNS responders (Avahi on Linux, mDNSResponder on macOS).
//! Tests may not discover services if no mDNS services are available on the network.
