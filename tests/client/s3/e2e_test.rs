//! E2E tests for S3 client
//!
//! These tests verify S3 client functionality by spawning the actual NetGet binary
//! and testing client behavior as a black-box.
//!
//! **Prerequisites:**
//! - MinIO or LocalStack running on localhost:9000 (for integration tests)
//! - AWS credentials configured (for real AWS S3 tests)
//!
//! **Note:** These tests are currently minimal and require a running S3-compatible
//! service for full E2E validation. See CLAUDE.md for test setup instructions.
