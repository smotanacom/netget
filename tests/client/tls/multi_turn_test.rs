//! The TLS client must keep talking after `wait_for_more`, and must not lose the
//! bytes it was asked to accumulate.
//!
//! Two defects this pins, both silent - the client stayed connected and simply
//! stopped answering:
//!
//! 1. **`wait_for_more` was terminal.** The read loop set the connection state to
//!    `Accumulating` and nothing ever moved it back, so every later read was appended
//!    to a queue that no code path read. One `wait_for_more` deafened the client for
//!    the rest of the session.
//! 2. **Data that arrived during a model call was cleared unread.** The branch that
//!    was supposed to process the queue did `queued_data.clear()`.
//!
//! The exchange below distinguishes both from a working client without any timing
//! assumption: the client answers `wait_for_more` *and* sends a nudge in the same
//! turn, so the server's next message is guaranteed to arrive while the client is
//! accumulating. A client with either defect never raises a third
//! `tls_client_data_received`, so the server never sees `DONE` and both mocks fail.
//!
//! The merged payload is asserted too - the third event must carry `PONG1PONG2`,
//! not `PONG2` - which is what proves the accumulated bytes survived rather than
//! being silently dropped.
