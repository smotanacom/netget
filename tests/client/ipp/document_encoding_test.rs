//! `print_job` guessed whether its document was base64, and printing the word `Test` got you
//! three bytes of binary.
//!
//! The parameter was documented as "Document content (text or base64 for binary)" and the
//! executor resolved the ambiguity by sniffing: all ASCII alphanumeric (plus `+`, `/`, `=`) and
//! a length divisible by four meant base64, anything else meant text. Those two sets overlap,
//! and they overlap on completely ordinary documents — `Test`, `Note`, `Data`, `Memo`, any
//! four-, eight- or twelve-character alphanumeric string.
//!
//! This is the `send_tcp_data` defect the root CLAUDE.md names as the reference case, wearing
//! base64 instead of hex: *"`48656c6c6f` is simultaneously valid text and valid hex and only
//! the sender knows which it means"*. The fix is the same — an explicit `encoding` field,
//! defaulting to text, never sniffed.
//!
//! The old guess had a second half worth pinning: a genuine base64 error was swallowed by
//! `unwrap_or_else(|_| document_data.as_bytes().to_vec())`, so a truncated document was printed
//! as its own base64 *text* and the model was told the job succeeded.
