//! Removing an IS-IS client must stop its pcap capture loop.
//!
//! # The defect this guards
//!
//! The capture loop used to decide whether to keep going like this:
//!
//! ```ignore
//! if let Some(client) = runtime.block_on(app_state.get_client(client_id)) {
//!     if matches!(client.status, ClientStatus::Disconnected | ClientStatus::Error(_)) {
//!         break;
//!     }
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! That covers `stop_capture`, which *sets* `ClientStatus::Disconnected`. It does not cover
//! removing the client, because [`AppState::remove_client`] **deletes the entry**
//! (`inner.clients.remove(&id)`) rather than marking it. `get_client` then returns `None`,
//! the `if let` does not match, and the loop keeps running -- still capturing, still calling
//! the LLM on every IS-IS PDU -- until the process exits.
//!
//! Aborting the blocking task is not an available fix: Tokio cannot unwind a thread parked in
//! `pcap::Capture::next_packet()`. That is what `crate::utils::StopSignal` exists for, and
//! `crate::server::isis` already used it. The client now does too.
//!
//! # What these tests do and do not prove
//!
//! They are **privilege-independent**: neither opens a pcap handle, so neither exercises the
//! capture loop itself. What they pin down is the two facts the fix rests on, both of which
//! were wrong or unchecked before:
//!
//! 1. `remove_client` really does delete the entry, so a `Some`-only liveness poll is dead
//!    code. (Test one. If this ever changes to a status update, the old poll would start
//!    working and this test tells you why the belt-and-braces `None` arm exists.)
//! 2. A `StopSignal` registered the way `src/client/isis/mod.rs` registers it -- via
//!    `register_client_task(client_id, stop.park_task())` -- is actually tripped by
//!    `remove_client`. (Test two: this is the link that was missing.)
//!
//! Neither of those, on its own, would fail against the old code: test two registers its own
//! signal and would pass even if the client registered none. Test three closes that gap the
//! way this repo's other whole-tree ratchets do -- by reading the source -- and asserts that
//! `src/client/isis/mod.rs` really does create a `StopSignal`, poll it in the capture loop,
//! and hand `park_task()` to `register_client_task`. Whether the loop breaks when the flag is
//! set cannot be observed here without root and a real interface, so source is the honest
//! level to check it at.
//!
//! Run with:
//!   ./cargo-isolated.sh test --no-default-features --features isis --test client -- isis::capture_stop --test-threads=100
