//! The dashboard's `[ send ]` path on an IS-IS client: `AppState::send_to_client` injects an
//! action from outside the client's capture loop.
//!
//! Zero LLM calls - the client's LLM points at an unreachable URL and this client makes no
//! connected-event call at all.
//!
//! # This client can never report `Sent`, and that is the honest answer
//!
//! The IS-IS client is a **receive-only** libpcap sniffer: it opens a capture, never a
//! transmit path, and its entire vocabulary is `analyze_topology` / `wait_for_more` (both of
//! which mean "keep listening; the analysis lives in the LLM's memory") and `stop_capture`.
//! So the outcomes asserted below are the truth, not a stub:
//!
//! * `analyze_topology` → `Executed` with a reason saying no PDU is transmitted;
//! * an unknown verb → `Rejected` by the protocol's own `execute_action`;
//! * `stop_capture` → `Disconnected`, which is real work: it marks the client disconnected,
//!   and the capture loop polls that status every iteration and breaks out.
//!
//! Because none of that touches the pcap handle, this test is privilege-independent. It
//! still points the client at an interface that does not exist so no capture is attempted.
//!
//! Run with:
//!   ./cargo-isolated.sh test --no-default-features --features isis --test client -- isis::command_channel --test-threads=100
