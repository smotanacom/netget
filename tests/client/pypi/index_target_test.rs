//! Where the PyPI client sends its traffic, and what it refuses to send.
//!
//! `resolve_index_url` used to end in `return "https://pypi.org".to_string()` for an empty
//! `remote_addr`, logging an INFO as it went. That is the class the root `CLAUDE.md` records as
//! "a client that loses its target must fail, never fall back to the real service": an address
//! that merely failed to arrive is indistinguishable, further down, from one the caller
//! deliberately omitted, so the fallback turns "I forgot to say where" into "talk to the public
//! index" with nothing an operator would read as a problem. It is milder than the DynamoDB case
//! — nothing here is signed with anybody's credentials — and it is the same shape.
//! `openai::api_base_for` faced the identical choice and refuses; so does this now.
//!
//! Driven through the real client creation path, so what is asserted is the index the client
//! recorded for itself, not a helper's return value.
//!
//! Run with:
//!   ./cargo-isolated.sh test --no-default-features --features pypi \
//!       --test client -- pypi::index_target --test-threads=100
