//! The MQTT client against **Eclipse Mosquitto** — the evidence its maturity rating rests on.
//!
//! NetGet's MQTT client is built on `rumqttc`; the broker here is `mosquitto`, a C
//! implementation that shares no code with it, and the peers on the other side of the broker
//! are Mosquitto's own `mosquitto_sub` and `mosquitto_pub`. Nothing on the wire was written by
//! this repository except NetGet itself.
//!
//! Both tests assert **condition 4 of the client bar** — the client acts on the model's answer,
//! asserted on the wire — from the far side of a real broker: a payload the mocked model chose
//! is read back by `mosquitto_sub`, and a message published by `mosquitto_pub` reaches the model
//! as an event whose fields are then quoted back onto the broker, so the assertion can only pass
//! if NetGet parsed Mosquitto's `PUBLISH` and put the model's reply into a `PUBLISH` Mosquitto
//! accepted and routed.
//!
//! **No test here skips.** A missing `mosquitto`, `mosquitto_sub` or `mosquitto_pub` fails with
//! the install command, because a skip-when-missing gate is a silent pass.
//!
//! LLM calls: 7 across the file (3 + 4).
//!
//! Run with:
//!   ./cargo-isolated.sh test --no-default-features --features mqtt --test client -- mqtt::real_server_test --test-threads=100
