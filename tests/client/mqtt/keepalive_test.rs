//! NetGet's MQTT client keeps its connection alive while a model turn is parked.
//!
//! The peer is the real Eclipse `mosquitto` broker, which enforces MQTT 3.1.1 §3.1.2.10: a
//! client that sends nothing for 1.5 × its keep-alive is disconnected. The client connects with
//! a 2-second keep-alive, and its `mqtt_connected` turn is parked on a `manual` rule for ten
//! seconds — more than three times the 3-second window. Then the test answers the turn with a
//! publish and checks, from the broker's side, that the publish arrived (`mosquitto_sub` is
//! subscribed and waiting) and, from NetGet's side, that the client never left `Connected`.
//!
//! That only holds if PINGREQ keeps going out while the turn waits. rumqttc writes PINGREQ only
//! while its `EventLoop::poll` is being awaited, so a client that ran the model turn inside the
//! loop that polls went silent for the whole turn and the broker dropped it; the answered
//! publish then went nowhere.
//!
//! Zero LLM calls: the only event is answered by the manual rule, and the client's model URL is
//! unreachable.
//!
//! The test **fails** when `mosquitto` or `mosquitto_sub` is absent rather than skipping: a
//! skip is a silent pass wherever the suite runs without them.
//!
//! Run with:
//!   ./cargo-isolated.sh test --no-default-features --features mqtt --test client -- mqtt::keepalive --test-threads=100
