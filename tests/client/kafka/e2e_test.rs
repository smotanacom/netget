//! E2E tests for the Kafka client.
//!
//! A mocked NetGet **broker** speaks Kafka to a mocked NetGet **client** over a real socket,
//! in two separate processes. Nothing here asserts NetGet against a reimplementation of
//! itself: the client encodes requests and decodes responses, the broker does the opposite,
//! and the assertions are on *content that crossed the wire and was decoded by the other
//! side*.
//!
//! The strongest assertion in each test reads a value out of the broker's own event data:
//!
//! * `test_kafka_client_produces_a_record_the_broker_decodes` captures the `records` array the
//!   broker decoded from the client's v2 record batch and compares it to the bytes the client
//!   was told to send. The key is handed to the client as **hex** and must arrive as the text
//!   it decodes to — if the client failed to honour `key_encoding` and put the literal string
//!   `"6f726465722d31"` on the wire, the broker would report exactly that and the assertion
//!   fails.
//! * `test_kafka_client_fetches_polls_and_commits` captures every `fetch_offset` the broker
//!   saw and the offset the client committed. The client is given one record at offset 0 and
//!   must work out for itself that the next fetch starts at 1 — which it can only do by
//!   decoding the record batch the broker encoded.
//!
//! ## What these replaced
//!
//! Four `#[ignore]`d tests whose premise was that no Kafka client was compiled into any
//! `--features kafka` build (`src/client/mod.rs` gated it on the `rdkafka` feature, which only
//! `all-protocols` turned on). The client is now pure Rust on `kafka-protocol`, `rdkafka` is
//! gone, and the ignores went with it. Two of those tests were also written against consumer
//! groups, which neither half implements; this suite assigns partitions manually instead,
//! which is what the broker actually supports.
//!
//! ## Harness note
//!
//! The mock server evaluates a `respond_with_actions_from_event` generator **twice** per
//! request — once to report routing consistency and once to build the answer. A generator that
//! appends to a list therefore records every value twice. The captures below are sets, and the
//! call counts come from `expect_calls` on the rules instead.
//!
//! LLM call budget: 6 (test A) + 8 (test B) = 14.
