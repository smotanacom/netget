//! A `bgp_update_received` handler's actions must reach the wire.
//!
//! `handle_update_message` used to pass `None` for the write half, on the reasoning that "this
//! client announces nothing, so an UPDATE handler cannot reply on the wire". That conflates
//! announcing *routes* with answering at all: this client's entire vocabulary is
//! `send_keepalive` / `send_notification` / `disconnect` / `wait_for_more`, none of which is a
//! route announcement, and tearing the peering down over a prefix the operator will not accept
//! is the obvious thing a monitor wants to do with an UPDATE.
//!
//! So every action a handler returned for that event was executed nowhere — the
//! "asks the model what to do and then throws the answer away" defect from the root CLAUDE.md,
//! softened only by a `warn!` that said it had been discarded. `tests/client/bgp/CLAUDE.md`
//! listed "the client's `disconnect` and `send_notification` actions reaching a peer" under
//! "Not covered", which is why it survived.
//!
//! ## Shape
//!
//! Like `hold_timer_test.rs` and for the same reasons, this drives
//! `BgpClient::connect_with_llm_actions` directly against a raw `TcpStream` peer that speaks
//! BGP by hand: the assertion is about specific octets (NOTIFICATION 6/2) rather than an event
//! firing, and the peer has to send an UPDATE at a moment of the test's choosing. The small
//! harness below is deliberately a copy of that file's rather than shared — `e2e_test.rs` and
//! `llm_failure_test.rs` in the server suite duplicate their framing helpers the same way.
//!
//! No Ollama is contacted. The reply comes from a **static event handler** registered on the
//! client, which `try_execute_client_event_handler` serves before the LLM budget is debited, so
//! the answer is deterministic and the model is never consulted for this event. (The one call
//! the client does make, on `bgp_connected`, goes to `127.0.0.1:1` and fails — the same path a
//! real client takes when the backend is down.)
//!
//! Run with:
//!   ./cargo-isolated.sh test --no-default-features --features bgp \
//!       --test client -- --test-threads=100 bgp
