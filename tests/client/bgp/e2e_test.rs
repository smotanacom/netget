//! E2E tests for the BGP client
//!
//! A mocked NetGet **server** speaks BGP to a mocked NetGet **client** over a real socket.
//! Every assertion is an event that only fires if bytes crossed the wire and parsed:
//!
//! * the server's `bgp_open` fires only if the client's OPEN arrived and decoded;
//! * the client's `bgp_connected` fires only if the server's OPEN *and* KEEPALIVE arrived and
//!   the session reached Established;
//! * the client's `bgp_update_received` with `nlri` matching fires only if the server's UPDATE
//!   arrived and was decoded into structured fields.
//!
//! ## What these replace
//!
//! The previous three tests could not pass and could not fail for a useful reason:
//!
//! 1. Every rule mocked `bgp_open_received` and `bgp_keepalive_received`. Neither event has
//!    ever existed on the rewritten BGP server, whose events are `bgp_open`,
//!    `bgp_established`, `bgp_update` and `bgp_notification`. No rule matched.
//! 2. The client rules answered `bgp_connected` with `send_bgp_open`, which is a *server*
//!    action. The BGP client cannot execute it, so `mock_action_names` panics while the test
//!    is being configured.
//! 3. Every assertion was `output_contains("BGP")` — satisfied by a log line saying the
//!    connection had failed.
