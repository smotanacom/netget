//! E2E tests for the STUN client, through the real NetGet binary.
//!
//! These used to be three `#[ignore]`d tests pointed at `stun.l.google.com:19302`. Each was
//! wrong in three separate ways and none of them could fail: they contacted an external
//! endpoint (the repo's rule is localhost only), they called `verify_mocks()` having
//! configured **no** mocks so the call asserted nothing, and they were ignored — so the
//! whole file was, in the root CLAUDE.md's phrase, evidence of nothing.
//!
//! They are now one test against a NetGet **STUN server** on loopback, and it runs. The
//! server answers a Binding request mechanically with no LLM call of its own (see
//! `src/server/stun/`), so the only mocked calls are the two the client makes: the startup
//! command and the client's own `stun_connected` event, whose answer is what puts the
//! binding request on the wire.
//!
//! What this proves that `tests/client/stun/command_channel_test.rs` does not: the
//! instruction → `stun_connected` → `send_binding_request` chain works when the *model*
//! drives it, rather than when a test injects the action directly.
