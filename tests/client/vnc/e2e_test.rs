//! E2E tests for the VNC client
//!
//! Each test starts a mocked NetGet VNC **server** and points a mocked NetGet VNC **client** at
//! it, so the whole exchange is determined and nothing depends on an external VNC host.
//!
//! All four tests were broken in the same three ways, and had been since they were written —
//! the same copy-paste rot found in the UDP and DNS client suites:
//!
//! 1. The rule meant to start the **server** answered with `open_client`. Even when it matched,
//!    no listener was ever opened.
//! 2. That `open_client` carried no `remote_addr`, which is required, so it was rejected with
//!    "LLM returned malformed action: open_client" before anything could happen.
//! 3. The client configs carried **no mock at all**, while still calling `verify_mocks()`.
//!
//! The matcher was `on_instruction_containing("vnc")` against prompts reading "via VNC", and
//! that comparison is a case-sensitive substring match, so it matched nothing either.
//!
//! `vnc_connected` firing on the client is the real assertion in every test: it can only happen
//! if the RFB handshake against the server actually completed. The server-side event mocks are
//! the other half — they are reachable only if the client's request crossed the wire.
