//! A model-supplied `target_port` narrowed with `as u16` tunnelled somewhere else.
//!
//! `66079 as u16` is `543`. `establish_tunnel` is how the model names where the CONNECT
//! should go, so the wrap sent the tunnel to a *different service on the same host* than the
//! one it asked for — quietly, with every log line downstream naming the port it ended up at
//! rather than the one it was given.
//!
//! This is the client-side form of the fail-open class: nothing reports an error, the tunnel
//! is established, and it is established to the wrong place. A client that loses its target
//! must fail rather than pick one.
