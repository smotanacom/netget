//! End-to-end tests for the LLMNR (RFC 4795) querier.
//!
//! **The evidence here is circular on two axes at once, and that is why the protocol is rated
//! Experimental.** Three of the four tests use NetGet's own LLMNR *responder* as the peer, so
//! both ends are this project's code; and both ends frame with `hickory-proto`, so even the
//! fourth test — which hand-builds its responses — is asserting that one codec round-trips
//! through itself. That is exactly the failure the root `CLAUDE.md` names for
//! `webrtc_signaling`/`websocket`. See `tests/client/llmnr/CLAUDE.md` for what was searched for
//! and why no independent peer is runnable here.
//!
//! What these tests *do* prove is the part that actually breaks: that a response is accepted
//! only when it carries the right transaction ID **and** echoes the right question, that a
//! query nobody answers is reported as its own expected outcome rather than as an error, that
//! two responders disagreeing is surfaced loudly instead of being resolved by whichever packet
//! arrived first, and that every event reaches the model and its answer is executed.
//!
//! ## Everything is unicast, deliberately
//!
//! `PROTOCOL_ROADMAP.md` records the measurement: bound to `127.0.0.1`, joining a multicast
//! group **succeeds** but *sending* to one fails with `EADDRNOTAVAIL` (49), because loopback
//! carries no multicast route. So no test here sends to `224.0.0.252`. Three of the four point
//! `remote_addr` straight at an ephemeral port; only
//! `test_llmnr_client_treats_no_answer_as_a_normal_outcome` opens the client on the real
//! multicast group, and it overrides the destination per query with `send_llmnr_query`'s
//! `target`, which is what that parameter exists for.
//!
//! ## `response_wait_secs` is raised in every test
//!
//! A query collects responses for a fixed window and *then* reports. The 2s default is right
//! for a link; it is not right for a hundred test processes sharing a machine, where the mocked
//! model behind the responder can take longer than that to answer. Every client here passes
//! `response_wait_secs` through `startup_params` so the window cannot expire before the peer
//! has had a chance to speak — a fixed wait that is too short would present as "the querier
//! ignored a valid answer", which is a product bug, not a timing one.
