//! SSDP / UPnP discovery **client** tests.
//!
//! Three layers, weakest evidence last, so it is obvious what each claim rests on and what
//! it does not.
//!
//! 1. **The executor and the request bytes, with no network and no LLM.** What the client
//!    puts on the wire is asserted by parsing it back with the *device* half's codec
//!    (`server::ssdp::message`), and every rejection the executor makes is pinned.
//! 2. **End to end against two devices hand-written in this file.** This is what proves the
//!    one-to-many shape — that a search collects replies for its whole window, raises one
//!    event per responder rather than returning on the first datagram, and that an
//!    unsolicited NOTIFY is surfaced too. Those devices are an independent reading of UDA
//!    1.1, **not** an independent implementation of it: same class as `dhcp`'s in-test RFC
//!    2131 decoder.
//! 3. **End to end against NetGet's own SSDP server**, two processes over unicast loopback.
//!    This is **same-project evidence**: it shows the two halves of NetGet agree, not that
//!    either matches a real UPnP device. It is why the client is `Experimental` and not
//!    `Beta`; see `tests/client/ssdp/CLAUDE.md` for what would actually earn Beta.
//!
//! Everything is unicast to 127.0.0.1. That is not a shortcut around a bug: bound to
//! loopback, *sending* to 239.255.255.250 fails with `EADDRNOTAVAIL` (49) because loopback
//! carries no multicast route — measured on macOS 27, where the group *join* succeeds and
//! only the send fails. UDA 1.1 §1.3.2 permits a unicast M-SEARCH, so this is a real search
//! rather than a testing-only shortcut, and it is what `send_msearch`'s `target` parameter
//! exists for.
