//! The dashboard's `[ send ]` path on a ZooKeeper client: `AppState::send_to_client` injects
//! an action from outside the connect task and the operation runs on the *live*
//! `zookeeper-async` session — the one `connect_with_llm_actions` established — reaching a
//! NetGet ZooKeeper server of our own.
//!
//! Zero LLM calls: the server answers through static handlers and the client's LLM points at
//! an unreachable URL, so its `zookeeper_connected` call fails and the connect path must
//! tolerate that. Verifying it does is part of the point.
//!
//! The whole exchange is a real ZooKeeper session — handshake, ping, and the four verbs below
//! — over 127.0.0.1. Nothing here is mocked at the protocol level.
//!
//! Run with:
//!   ./cargo-isolated.sh test --no-default-features --features zookeeper --test client -- zookeeper::command_channel --test-threads=100

/// requires. `{{event.xid}}` is not optional: a ZooKeeper client correlates replies to
/// requests by xid and desynchronises if it is wrong.
/// One script handler, branching on the request's operation.
///
/// It cannot be five static rules. `EventHandler` has exactly two fields --
/// `event_pattern` and `handler` -- so there is no data-based matching for server
/// event handlers, and every rule registered against `zookeeper_request` matches every
/// request. First-match-wins then made the `create` rule answer a `getData`, and the
/// client got a reply with no `Stat` where a `GetDataResponse` was due: `MarshallingError`.
///
/// `resident` is required, not incidental: a resident script defines
/// `handle(event_type, event, message)`, while a non-resident one must read stdin and
/// print its own output. Defining `handle` without `resident` produces no output at all,
/// the handler yields no actions, and the server fails closed -- which the client sees as
/// `SystemError`.
///
/// Each reply echoes the request's own `xid`. A ZooKeeper client correlates replies to
/// requests by that value and desynchronizes for the rest of the connection if it differs.
