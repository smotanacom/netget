//! The Tor client's shared action executor — the thing that was missing.
//!
//! `tor_connected` and `tor_bootstrap_complete` both asked the model what to do and threw the
//! answer away (`Ok(_) => trace!("LLM called successfully")`, and an `if let Err(..)` whose
//! success arm did not exist). Both now run their actions through [`apply_actions`], which is
//! also what the read loop uses, so the vocabulary is executed in exactly one place.
//!
//! A live test would need `create_bootstrapped()` to complete a real directory bootstrap and
//! build a circuit — see `command_channel_test.rs` for why there is no cheap loopback for
//! that. What is reachable, and what the two fixed call sites actually depend on, is the
//! executor's contract:
//!
//!  1. `disconnect` returns `true`, which is how the read loop learns to stop. Before the fix
//!     a `disconnect` only `break`ed the `for action in actions` loop, so the model could
//!     never close a Tor client at all.
//!  2. With no circuit yet — `tor_bootstrap_complete` fires while `connect()` is still
//!     bootstrapping — `send_tor_data` is refused *loudly* rather than dropped, and does not
//!     abort the rest of the answer.
//!  3. An action the protocol rejects is reported, not swallowed.
//!
//! Run with:
//!   ./cargo-isolated.sh test --no-default-features --features tor --test client -- tor::apply_actions --test-threads=100
