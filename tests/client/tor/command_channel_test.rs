//! The dashboard's `[ send ]` path on a Tor client — the closest cheap variant, and why.
//!
//! A live "bytes arrive on the wire" test is disproportionate here. Reaching the Tor client's
//! read loop (where `command_support::register_command_channel` runs) requires
//! `arti_client::TorClient::create_bootstrapped()` to complete a real directory bootstrap and
//! then build a circuit to the destination. There is no cheap loopback for that: it needs the
//! `tor_relay` server speaking the OR protocol + BEGIN_DIR (see `tests/client/tor/CLAUDE.md`),
//! which is a whole multi-server harness, not a command-channel injection test. And by policy
//! the client refuses to bootstrap at all without an explicit opt-in (see `test.rs`).
//!
//! So this verifies the reachable halves of the command-channel contract without a circuit:
//!  1. `send_to_client` to a client with no registered handle is refused (the negative path the
//!     dashboard relies on to grey out `[ send ]`), and
//!  2. the Tor client's `execute_action` maps `send_tor_data` → `SendData` and `disconnect` →
//!     `Disconnect` — exactly the vocabulary the generic `handle_stream_client_command` arm this
//!     client wires up would put on the wire once a handle exists.
//!
//! Run with:
//!   ./cargo-isolated.sh test --no-default-features --features tor --test client -- tor::command_channel --test-threads=100
