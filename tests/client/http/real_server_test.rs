//! The HTTP client against **nginx** — the evidence its maturity rating rests on.
//!
//! NetGet's HTTP client is `reqwest` over hyper; the server here is nginx, a C implementation
//! with its own HTTP parser, spawned per test by `tests/helpers/real_server.rs` with a config
//! written into its temp dir. HTTP *is* the protocol this client speaks, so a real HTTP server is
//! exactly the right peer — the generic-HTTP exclusion in the root `CLAUDE.md` rules out
//! protocols layered on HTTP, not HTTP itself.
//!
//! Condition 4 of the client bar — the client acts on the model's answer, asserted on the wire —
//! is asserted from nginx's side, through **nginx's own access log**: every request line, the
//! `X-NetGet` header, the `User-Agent` and the request body length the model's actions produced
//! are recorded there by nginx, and the test reads them back. One of those header values was
//! built by the model from a response body it was shown.
//!
//! **No test here skips.** A missing `nginx` fails with the install command.
//!
//! LLM calls: 5.
//!
//! Run with:
//!   ./cargo-isolated.sh test --no-default-features --features http --test client -- http::real_server_test --test-threads=100
