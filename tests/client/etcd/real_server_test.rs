//! The etcd client against a real **`etcd`** — the evidence its maturity rating rests on.
//!
//! NetGet's etcd client is `etcd-client`, which is Rust on tonic. The server here is the
//! official Go `etcd`, whose gRPC stack is grpc-go: no code in common with the client, and the
//! stricter of the two gRPC implementations this repository has met (grpc-go refused the
//! trailers shape tonic tolerated; see the root `CLAUDE.md`). State is read back with the
//! official `etcdctl`.
//!
//! Condition 4 of the client bar — the client acts on the model's answer, asserted on the wire
//! — is asserted from the server's side: `etcdctl` reads a key whose value the mocked model
//! built from a GET reply it was shown, and finds absent the key the model deleted.
//!
//! **No test here skips.** A missing `etcd` or `etcdctl` fails with the install command.
//!
//! LLM calls: 6.
//!
//! Run with:
//!   ./cargo-isolated.sh test --no-default-features --features etcd --test client -- etcd::real_server_test --test-threads=100
