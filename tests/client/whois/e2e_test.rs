//! E2E tests for the WHOIS client, against NetGet's own WHOIS server on loopback.
//!
//! **These three tests used to query `whois.iana.org` and `whois.verisign-grs.com`.** They
//! were `#[ignore]`d for it, correctly — the repo's testing rules are "bind to localhost only;
//! never contact external endpoints", and a test with no `.with_mock()` also needs a real
//! Ollama. So they ran nowhere, asserted nothing, and still sat in the tree looking like
//! coverage of the client's model-driven path, which had none.
//!
//! They are now one test that runs, following the shape of
//! `tests/client/finger/e2e_test.rs::test_finger_client_round_trip_against_netget_server`:
//! a NetGet WHOIS server and a NetGet WHOIS client, both on mocked models, on loopback. The
//! mock's response generator runs *inside* this test, so what it captures is the model's
//! actual view of the event — which is the only way to assert the fields the client puts on
//! `whois_response_received`.
//!
//! LLM calls: 4 (two startups, one server-side query, one client-side response).
