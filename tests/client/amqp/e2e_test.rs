//! E2E tests for the AMQP client
//!
//! A mocked NetGet **broker** and a mocked NetGet **client** (lapin) over a real socket.
//!
//! ## What these replace
//!
//! `test_amqp_client_connect` could not run at all. Two mocks were stale and one was
//! impossible:
//!
//! 1. The broker rule answered `amqp_connection_received` with `send_amqp_frame`. Neither the
//!    event nor the action exists on the rewritten AMQP broker, whose handshake event is
//!    `amqp_connection_open` and whose reply is `amqp_connection_open_ok`. Nothing matched, so
//!    the broker never let the client in and `lapin::Connection::connect` never returned.
//! 2. The client rule answered `amqp_connected` with `wait_for_more`, which is not an AMQP
//!    client action — the client's whole vocabulary is `open_channel` and `disconnect` — so
//!    `mock_action_names` panicked while the test was being configured.
//! 3. Every `expect_calls` was commented out, so `verify_mocks()` asserted nothing.
