//! The dashboard's `[ send ]` path on an XMPP client.
//!
//! What this pins without a server: the command channel is registered before the session is
//! up (and so before the `xmpp_connected` LLM call, which a manual rule can park for minutes),
//! injected actions run through the protocol's own `execute_action` so an unknown name is
//! refused rather than swallowed, the outcome is recorded in the client's access log, and an
//! injected `disconnect` shuts the stream down, drops the handle and fails a session that never
//! came up.
//!
//! The "server" is a loopback listener that accepts and never answers, so the client sits with
//! its session pending - `ClientForm::create` does not return until it is online or has failed,
//! which is why it runs in its own task here.
//!
//! What it does **not** pin: a stanza actually reaching a peer. `tokio_xmpp::Client::send_stanza`
//! resolves only once the stanza has been written to the transport, and no XMPP server this
//! suite can start (the NetGet XMPP server does not complete tokio-xmpp's STARTTLS/SASL
//! negotiation) gives us that transport - so `send_message` is left to a real server, exactly as
//! `tests/client/xmpp/e2e_test.rs` does. See `src/client/xmpp/AGENTS.md`.
//!
//! Run with:
//!   ./cargo-isolated.sh test --no-default-features --features xmpp --test client -- xmpp::command_channel --test-threads=100
