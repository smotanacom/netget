//! An XMPP client that has ended dials its target no more.
//!
//! tokio-xmpp 5.0 runs its connect-and-login loop in a task it spawns itself and retries every
//! failed attempt (1s backoff, doubling to 30s) until a login succeeds; dropping the `Client`
//! does not reach that task. The client therefore builds its `tokio_xmpp::Client` on a connector
//! that refuses to dial once the client has ended, by whichever path it ended. Each test here
//! ends a client a different way - the session timeout, an injected `disconnect`, a stop - and
//! then counts the connections arriving at the target for a window longer than the library's
//! first backoffs. Before the client ends, the same listener sees the library redial, so a
//! quiet window means the dialling stopped rather than never started.
//!
//! The "server" accepts and drops every connection at once, so each attempt fails within
//! milliseconds and the library's next one comes on its backoff schedule: from the first
//! attempt at 0s, the next are at about 1s, 3s, 7s and 15s.
//!
//! **A model-produced `disconnect` is not driven here**, and cannot be by this suite: every
//! event the model answers (`xmpp_connected`, `xmpp_message_received`, `xmpp_presence_received`)
//! comes after tokio-xmpp's `Online`, which needs STARTTLS with a certificate the library
//! trusts, SASL and resource binding, and no XMPP server this suite can start completes that
//! (see `src/client/xmpp/AGENTS.md`). What the model path shares with the injected one is
//! `end_session` - a model `disconnect` and an injected one both cancel the same token and drop
//! the same handle - so the injected-disconnect test below is the evidence for both.
//!
//! Nothing here leaves 127.0.0.1, and no model is called (the LLM URL is `127.0.0.1:1`, and the
//! client makes no model call before `Online`).
//!
//! Run with:
//!   ./cargo-isolated.sh test --no-default-features --features xmpp --test client -- xmpp::redial --test-threads=100
