//! End-to-end Finger (RFC 1288) **client** tests.
//!
//! Two instruments, deliberately, because they prove different things:
//!
//! * **NetGet's own Finger server** is the peer for the round trip. Be clear about what that
//!   is worth: it is *same-project evidence*. It shows the two halves of NetGet agree with each
//!   other, not that either half matches RFC 1288 — the circular-evidence class the root
//!   `CLAUDE.md` names, and the reason this client is rated `Experimental`.
//! * **A raw `TcpListener`** is the peer wherever the assertion is about the bytes this client
//!   emits. Nothing in the loop can talk it into agreeing: the query line is compared literally,
//!   and "no bytes at all" is asserted the same way. That is what makes the forwarding-refusal
//!   test mean something.
//!
//! Everything binds 127.0.0.1 on an ephemeral port. Nothing leaves the host.
