//! The test suite must not leave `netget` processes behind when it is killed.
//!
//! Measured 16 September 2026: **78 orphaned `netget` processes** alive on one
//! machine, all at PPID 1, accumulated over ten hours — 73 from
//! `/tmp/vfull/debug/netget` and five from `/tmp/netget-eval-target/debug/netget`,
//! both ordinary `CARGO_TARGET_DIR`s. They hold loopback ports, memory and file
//! descriptors, and they make every later measurement dishonest: a whole day of
//! "load-sensitive flakes" was investigated on a machine quietly carrying dozens
//! of them.
//!
//! Two mechanisms, tested separately here because they fail in different ways:
//!
//! - **The death tie** (`child_guard::arm_death_tie`) — the hard-kill half. A
//!   `Drop` guard cannot be the whole answer, because `Drop` does not run when
//!   the test binary is `SIGKILL`ed. `sigkilled_parent_takes_its_child_with_it`
//!   proves the tie by actually `SIGKILL`ing a parent.
//! - **The sweeper** (`child_guard::is_orphaned_test_netget`) — for what is
//!   already loose. Its predicate is unit-tested below against real `ps` lines,
//!   including the operator's own live `--mcp` session, because `CLAUDE.md`'s
//!   standing rule is that netget processes are never killed and this is the one
//!   narrow exception.
//!
//! # The shape of the hard-kill test
//!
//! A test cannot `SIGKILL` itself and then assert anything, so it re-executes
//! **its own binary** as a worker: the worker runs one hidden `#[test]` (gated on
//! `NETGET_REAP_WORKER`), spawns a child under a death tie, prints the child's
//! pid, and then blocks forever. The outer test reads that pid, `SIGKILL`s the
//! worker, and watches for the child to disappear.
//!
//! `SIGKILL` on the worker is the point: it is the one signal a process cannot
//! handle, so nothing in the worker — not `Drop`, not a panic hook, not an
//! atexit handler — can be what cleans up. Whatever kills the child is outside
//! the worker, which is exactly the claim under test.

// The whole shared harness, because the netget half of this test drives the real
// `start_netget` path — mock Ollama and all. netget refuses to start without a
// reachable backend, so a hand-rolled spawn of the binary exits within a second
// and the test then passes for the wrong reason. It did exactly that once: with
// the reaper deliberately neutered to prove the test could fail, the netget case
// still went green, because its child had died on its own.
