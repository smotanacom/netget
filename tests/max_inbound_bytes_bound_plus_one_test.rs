//! Every declared `max_inbound_bytes` bound, driven from a socket: send bound+1, and the
//! model must never see it.
//!
//! `ProtocolMetadataV2::max_inbound_bytes`' own doc comment sets the standard — "every
//! declaration should have a test that sends this many bytes plus one and asserts the refusal
//! happens *before* any model call. A bound nobody tested is a comment." Each bound that landed
//! has such a test, written by hand for that protocol. This is the generic one: it reads the
//! number off the registry and probes every protocol that declares it, so a bound added
//! tomorrow is probed the day it is added rather than when somebody remembers.
//!
//! # What this proves, and what it deliberately does not
//!
//! **It proves the DoS property**, which is the one that is the same in every protocol: bytes
//! past the bound do not reach the model and do not leave the connection parked holding them.
//! A server that buffered `bound + 1` bytes and handed them to an LLM would be charging a
//! stranger's oversized message to the model backend, and the mock counts that directly.
//!
//! **It does not prove that the declared number is the number that fired.** For a line-oriented
//! protocol it is: `bound + 1` bytes with no newline is exactly an over-long line. For a
//! length-prefixed one the first bytes are read as a header, so what refuses may be the length
//! check rather than the byte bound, and the two are not distinguishable from outside. That is
//! the job of the per-protocol tests, which construct a legal-looking message that declares
//! `bound + 1` in the protocol's own vocabulary — and it is why this file is an addition to
//! them rather than a replacement.
//!
//! # Refusal, defined so that it means something in every protocol at once
//!
//! A protocol's refusal vocabulary is its own: a `connection.close` frame, a 413, an RESP
//! error, a plain hang-up. What they share is that the server **decides** — so the assertion is
//!
//! > within the deadline the server either closed the connection or wrote something back,
//! > **and** the model was called zero times.
//!
//! Failing that means the server silently swallowed an over-bound message and is sitting on it,
//! which is the shape of every defect this metadata field exists to make visible. The
//! "wrote something back" arm is what lets a protocol that answers an error and keeps the
//! connection alive (HTTP with keep-alive, most obviously) pass honestly rather than being
//! written off as unbounded.
//!
//! # Coverage is asserted, not assumed
//!
//! A probe that quietly covers half the tree is worse than none — this repository has shipped
//! that mistake three times, most recently in a ratchet that walked the registry and so went
//! green on a six-protocol build for reasons unrelated to what it checked. So:
//!
//! * every protocol compiled into this build that declares `max_inbound_bytes` is either
//!   **probed** or skipped for a reason that is either derived (not a TCP stream, needs
//!   privilege beyond a privileged port, bound past [`MAX_PROBE_BYTES`]) or written down in
//!   [`NOT_PROBED`];
//! * a declaring protocol that is in neither fails the test by name — including one that will
//!   not *start* here, because a server this file cannot start is coverage it does not have;
//! * the three real findings from its first run are in [`KNOWN_FINDINGS`], shrink-only, with
//!   what the probe saw. They are reported rather than exempted, and a baselined protocol that
//!   starts passing fails the test so the entry gets deleted;
//! * the full probed/skipped split prints on every run, so coverage is readable rather than
//!   inferred.
//!
//! Because it walks the **registry** it only sees what this build compiled, which is the
//! inescapable cost of a behavioural test — you cannot start a server that is not there. Run it
//! at `--all-features` to see the whole tree; `registry-audit` is the job that does.
//!
//! # The traps this file is built around
//!
//! **Wait for the listener.** A connection racing the bind is refused at connect, and that
//! reads exactly like "the bound closed my connection" — a false pass, in the direction that
//! matters. `connect_when_listening` retries the connect itself rather than trusting that
//! `local_addr` being set means `accept` is running.
//!
//! **Count from a baseline, not from zero.** Several protocols speak first and what they say is
//! the model's — NNTP and SVN generate their greeting. Counting every call against the payload
//! reported five protocols as enforcing nothing, which was this probe's mistake and not theirs.
//! `settled_call_count` is taken after the connect settles and subtracted.
//!
//! **A privileged default port is not a reason to skip.** Everything here starts on port 0, so
//! `PrivilegedPort(80)` never comes into it. Treating it as a skip cost seventeen protocols
//! including `http`, `imap`, `ftp`, `smtp`, `ssh`, `telnet` and `whois`.
//!
//! **The registry's name is the display form.** `"Bitcoin P2P"`, `"XML-RPC"`, `"SSH Agent"` —
//! not the source directory. Every table here is keyed case-insensitively on that name, because
//! the first version keyed on the directory and its entries matched nothing at all.
//!
//! **The instruction must be non-empty.** `ServerForm::create` substitutes a default
//! instruction for `None`, and any non-empty instruction makes `operator_wants_dynamic` true —
//! which is the condition under which the model *would* be consulted. A probe built with
//! `..Default::default()` and no instruction, or with an `event_handlers` rule, would measure
//! nothing: the zero would be the routing table's, not the bound's.
//!
//! Run with:
//!   ./cargo-isolated.sh test --all-features --test max_inbound_bytes_bound_plus_one_test -- --test-threads=100
