//! Ratchet: every TCP accept-loop server declares a read deadline and a connection cap.
//!
//! This reads the **source tree**, not the registry, so it holds at any feature set — including
//! the six-protocol CI gate, where a registry-walking test only ever sees what that build
//! compiled. Every protocol directory under `src/server` whose `mod.rs` opens a TCP accept loop
//! must name a timeout constant *and* go through `crate::server::accept_bounded`, somewhere in
//! that directory (nfs declares both in `guard.rs`, which is the right place for it).
//!
//! # This test could not see two thirds of the tree, and that is the part worth reading
//!
//! Until 16 September 2026 the derivation was `mod_src.contains("TcpListener")`. Most servers
//! here do not write that: they call `crate::server::socket_helpers::create_reusable_tcp_listener`,
//! whose *return type* is a `TcpListener` but whose call site never names one. So this ratchet
//! walked **32** servers while **92** open a TCP accept loop, and the 60 it could not see
//! included `http`, `tcp`, `telnet`, `ssh`, `ldap`, `imap`, `grpc`, `modbus`, `git` and
//! `kubernetes`.
//!
//! **47 of those 60 had neither bound** — no cap and no deadline. A peer that connects and says
//! nothing holds a socket, a task and an `AppState` entry forever, pre-authentication, on a
//! server that will happily accept a hundred more; that is the free denial of service this test
//! exists to prevent, and it was sitting behind the test's own blind spot.
//!
//! The lesson is the recurring one in this repository: **the test counted a token, not the
//! thing.** A source-reading check must match every way the thing is actually written, and a
//! green result over an unmeasured population is worse than no check, because it is trusted.
//!
//! # The baselines are large on purpose
//!
//! Both are **shrink-only**, and they now record real, measured debt rather than an artefact of
//! what the derivation happened to match. Adding a protocol to either is not a fix; it is a
//! statement, with a reason, that the bound cannot be expressed there — and the reason has to be
//! good enough to survive review. Removing one is the work.
//!
//! Run with:
