//! The pcap oracle — an **independent** decoder for the bytes NetGet puts on the wire.
//!
//! Every other assertion in this suite is NetGet agreeing with itself, or with one
//! third-party client that can agree with one bug. `tshark` is neither: it is a
//! spec-literate dissector for ~109 of the protocols in this registry, written by
//! people who read the RFCs, and it is already installed. Point it at what a server
//! emitted and it will say whether the bytes are the protocol they claim to be.
//!
//! # How it works
//!
//! The test captures what NetGet wrote **from its own socket** — no capture
//! privilege, no interface, no `sudo`. It hands those bytes here. This module
//! fabricates the framing tshark needs around them (Ethernet + IPv4 + TCP/UDP, or a
//! raw Ethernet frame for the link-layer protocols), writes a one-off pcap file, and
//! runs `tshark` over it with a `-d` decode-as clause naming the dissector.
//!
//! The dissector name comes from [`netget::tui::wireshark::wire_for`], which is the
//! one place in this tree where every Wireshark name has already been checked against
//! this machine's `tshark -d` / `-Y`. Nothing here invents a name.
//!
//! # Why the pcap is hand-built rather than produced by `text2pcap`
//!
//! `text2pcap` can wrap a hex dump in Ethernet/IP/TCP headers (`-e`, `-i`, `-T`,
//! `-u`) and would have saved the fifty lines below. It was rejected for three
//! reasons, each of which showed up as a *false failure* while calibrating:
//!
//! 1. **TCP sequence numbers.** A stream needs per-direction sequence tracking or
//!    tshark reports retransmissions and out-of-order segments — Warn-severity
//!    expert info, i.e. exactly what this oracle fails on. Building the segments
//!    here means the numbers are right by construction.
//! 2. **A connection needs to open and close.** Several dissectors desegment until
//!    the stream ends: `whois`'s answer is dissected only once a FIN is seen (this
//!    was measured, not assumed — without the FIN the reply is plain `tcp`).
//!    `text2pcap` emits data segments only.
//! 3. **No second process, no hex round-trip.** The bytes are already in memory;
//!    formatting them as an offset-prefixed hex dump for another binary to parse
//!    back is a second place to get the offsets wrong.
//!
//! # What counts as a failure
//!
//! * any **Expert Info at Warn severity or above** on any packet — this is where
//!   `[Malformed Packet]`, bad checksums, "option longer than the package" and every
//!   wrong-flag-bit class live;
//! * the requested dissector **not appearing** in `frame.protocols` for a direction
//!   that carried bytes — i.e. tshark fell back to `data`/plain TCP because it could
//!   not make sense of the framing. This check has no expert info behind it at all:
//!   an 802.3 frame carrying an EtherType where the length belongs dissects as
//!   `eth:ethertype:data` in complete silence, and that is the shape of a defect
//!   Programme 2 found in CDP by hand.
//!
//! Everything below Warn is *reported but not failed*. That is deliberate: the
//! synthetic capture legitimately produces Chat and Note entries ("Connection
//! establish request (SYN)", "WHOIS has no mechanism to indicate encoding"), and a
//! noisy oracle is an ignored oracle.
//!
//! # `tshark` missing is a failure, not a skip
//!
//! This repository's own rule: a gate that prints `SKIP` and returns `Ok(())` is a
//! silent pass, and a silent pass is how four Beta ratings came to rest on nothing.
//! If `tshark` is not on `PATH` the oracle panics and says how to install it.
