//! Tests for the `DevelopmentState` maturity ordering, its case-insensitive
//! parse, and the `--min-stability` start gate.
//!
//! The ordering/parse tests need no protocol features (metadata is always
//! compiled). The enforcement test needs a Beta protocol and an Experimental
//! one to exist in the registry, so it is gated on `tcp` (Beta) + `redis`
//! (Experimental) — both are in the CI `test` feature set. Nothing here
//! contacts the network: the LLM client points at a closed loopback port and
//! the Experimental protocol is refused *before* any spawn.
