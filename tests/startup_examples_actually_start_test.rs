//! Every `get_startup_examples()` entry must parse as an `open_server` action and produce a
//! server that reaches `ServerStatus::Running`.
//!
//! `tests/startup_examples_validation_test.rs` checks the **shape** of these examples: the
//! `type` is `open_server`, a `base_stack` is present, script mode carries a script handler.
//! Shape is what a reader can see. What it cannot see is whether the thing starts.
//!
//! These three JSON blobs are the most-copied text a protocol publishes. They are what the
//! model is shown when it asks how to open the protocol, what a person pastes into `--mcp`,
//! and what the docs render. An example that does not start is a defect that reaches every
//! caller at once, and nothing else in the tree looks at it — `startup_params` keys that the
//! protocol never declared are rejected at startup, and a handler whose event pattern names
//! an event the protocol does not raise simply never matches.
//!
//! # What this does and does not prove
//!
//! It proves the example parses through the same `CommonAction::from_json` the model's answer
//! goes through, that its `startup_params` and `event_handlers` survive validation, and that
//! the protocol binds. It does **not** prove the handler answers correctly — the BLE examples
//! that motivated this item were inert because `actions = [{...}]` under `python3 -c` assigns
//! a local and prints nothing, so the handler was recorded as failed and the event fell
//! through to the LLM. That is a *runtime* defect of the handler body, and it needs traffic to
//! surface; it is Tier 4's real-model eval, not this. Say so rather than letting a green run
//! here read as "the examples work".
//!
//! # The port is overridden, deliberately
//!
//! Examples name the protocol's real default port — 79 for finger, 70 for gopher, 6379 for
//! redis. Binding those would test the machine rather than the example: below 1024 needs
//! privilege, and at `--test-threads=100` two examples on the same port collide. Every spawn
//! here is on port 0, so what is under test is the handler table and the startup parameters.
//! Whether the declared default port is bindable is a property of the operator's machine and
//! is not something an example can get wrong.
//!
//! Run with:
//!   ./cargo-isolated.sh test --no-default-features --features all-protocols \
//!       --test startup_examples_actually_start_test -- --test-threads=100 --nocapture
