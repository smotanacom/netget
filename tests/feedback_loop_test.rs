//! The `provide_feedback` loop, end to end.
//!
//! `feedback_instructions` is a documented `open_server`/`open_client` parameter, and
//! setting it makes `call_llm` and `call_llm_for_client` advertise a `provide_feedback`
//! tool. Calling that tool pushed an entry onto `ServerInstance::feedback_buffer` — and
//! that was the end of it. Nothing ever read the buffer, and `call_llm_for_feedback`, which
//! knows how to turn a batch of entries into adjustment actions, had **zero callers**. The
//! documented behaviour ("feedback is accumulated and debounced, then the LLM adjusts the
//! server") was fiction, and a tool whose output goes nowhere is worse than no tool: the
//! model cannot tell that its report was discarded.
//!
//! `src/llm/feedback.rs` is the missing drain, polled from the same 1s timer that runs due
//! scheduled tasks. These tests pin both halves:
//!
//! * `take_due_feedback` — the debounce contract, without an LLM.
//! * the E2E — a real TCP peer triggers a network event, the model answers with
//!   `provide_feedback`, and the *second* LLM call is the feedback call, whose
//!   `update_instruction` lands on the server the feedback came from. Before the drain
//!   existed the second call never happened at all, which is exactly what
//!   `verify_mocks()` now enforces.
//!
//! ```bash
//! ./cargo-isolated.sh test --no-default-features --features tcp \
//!     --test feedback_loop_test -- --test-threads=100
//! ```

#![cfg(feature = "tcp")]
// `mod helpers` compiles the whole shared E2E harness into this binary; this file uses a
// small slice of it. Same situation as `tests/server.rs`.
