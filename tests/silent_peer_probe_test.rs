//! What NetGet's own client of a protocol does to a socket *before* anyone tells it to.
//!
//! ## Why this exists
//!
//! Several NetGet servers bound how long they will wait for a peer's **first byte**. That
//! bound is a defence — a peer that connects and says nothing holds a task, an `AppState`
//! row and one of `MAX_CONNECTIONS` slots, pre-authentication, and nothing else in the
//! process will ever close it. But the bound also has a victim: NetGet's *own* client of the
//! same protocol, created from the dashboard, is routed `*` -> manual, so it can sit
//! connected and silent for as long as a person takes to type into `[ send message ]` — a
//! window `src/state/intercepts.rs` puts at 300 seconds. `tcp`, `telnet`, `ldap`, `whois` and
//! `redis` each had a 30-second first-byte bound that dropped the operator's own client while
//! they were still looking at it, and each was raised to 300.
//!
//! Every other protocol was left alone, and the exemption rested on a throwaway measurement
//! that was never committed. This file is that measurement, made permanent.
//!
//! ## The three-way classification, and why a byte count alone is not enough
//!
//! A first-byte bound can only ever strand a peer that is **connected and silent**. So the
//! question for each protocol is: can NetGet's own client ever *be* that peer? A client that
//! puts no bytes on the wire looks identical to a client that opened no socket if you only
//! count bytes — and they are completely different answers:
//!
//! | accepts | bytes | classification | what it means for the server's first-byte bound |
//! |---|---|---|---|
//! | 0 | 0 | **lazy** — no socket until an operation is issued | irrelevant: there is no connection to strand |
//! | >= 1 | > 0 | **speaks inside `connect()`** | irrelevant: the first byte has already arrived |
//! | >= 1 | 0 | **connected and silent** | the bound is load-bearing and must outlast a human |
//!
//! Only the third row makes a short bound a defect. The first two are exemptions for
//! genuinely different reasons, and a test that collapsed them would go on passing if a lazy
//! client were made eager — which is exactly the change that would break the exemption.
//!
//! ## How it is measured
//!
//! A bare `tokio::net::TcpListener` counts **accepts** and **bytes** separately, and a client
//! is pointed at it through `ClientForm` — the same path the dashboard's `[ + <proto> client ]`
//! takes. The instruction is empty and the LLM endpoint is a dead port, so nothing the model
//! could say is what puts bytes on the wire: what arrives is the client library's own doing,
//! inside `connect()`. `ClientForm::create` is deliberately **not** awaited — a client that
//! speaks and then waits for an answer our listener will never give (postgresql, mssql,
//! cassandra) would never return — so the probe watches the counters instead of the result.
//!
//! ## The window
//!
//! [`WINDOW`] is 5 seconds, and the probe **returns the moment bytes arrive**, so only the
//! "nothing happened" verdict pays it. A library that speaks inside `connect()` does so in the
//! same task as the connect: measured here, every one of them is on the wire within **22-72ms**
//! (postgresql, mssql, cassandra and mongodb at ~22ms, couchdb at ~72ms because it builds a
//! reqwest client first). The documented worst case for that reqwest build is ~650ms under
//! heavy process concurrency — the macOS system-proxy probe against configd, see the root
//! CLAUDE.md — so 5 seconds is ~70x the observed cost and ~7x the pathological one. The whole
//! file's wall clock is one window (~5.2s measured), because the tests run in parallel and only
//! the lazy and silent verdicts wait it out.
//!
//! ## One test per protocol, feature-gated
//!
//! Deliberately **not** one test gated on every feature at once: that would compile in no
//! ordinary build and would only ever run under the non-blocking `registry-audit` job.
//! Whatever feature set you compile runs exactly the relevant subset.
//!
//! Run with:
//!   ./cargo-isolated.sh test --no-default-features --features redis,tcp,telnet \
//!       --test silent_peer_probe_test -- --test-threads=100
