//! Every server either declares the port it is registered for, or says why it has none.
//!
//! `ProtocolMetadataV2::well_known_port` is what a server starts on when the caller names no
//! port (the picker, the create form, MCP `start_server`, `open_server`, `--server`), resolved
//! through `netget::protocol::default_port`. Before it existed every socket server started on an
//! OS-assigned port unless the caller knew the number, and the only place a well-known port was
//! written down at all was `PrivilegeRequirement::PrivilegedPort(n)` — for the 30-odd protocols
//! below 1024, as a privilege advisory, and read by nothing that picks a port.
//!
//! Four checks, all by reading source so they hold at every feature set (the blocking CI job
//! compiles 6 of ~160 servers, so a registry walk would see almost nothing):
//!
//! 1. every server declares `.well_known_port(n)` / `.well_known_udp_port(n)` /
//!    `.well_known_sctp_port(n)` — or the struct-literal `well_known_port: Some(n)` — or is in
//!    [`NO_WELL_KNOWN_PORT`] with the reason;
//! 2. every `PrivilegedPort(n)` agrees with the declared well-known port, so the privilege
//!    advisory and the default port cannot name two different numbers;
//! 3. the declared transport agrees with the protocol's own `stack_name()` where that names
//!    TCP, UDP or SCTP — a UDP port probed with a TCP bind says nothing about whether it is free;
//! 4. every entry in the list names a protocol that exists and gives a real reason.
//!
//! Run with:
//!   ./cargo-isolated.sh test --no-default-features --features tcp \
//!       --test well_known_port_declaration_test
