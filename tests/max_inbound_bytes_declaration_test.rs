//! A server that buffers a peer-chosen number of bytes must **declare** the ceiling.
//!
//! `ProtocolMetadataV2::max_inbound_bytes` exists so the question "what is the largest thing a
//! stranger can make this server allocate?" has an answer that can be grepped, tested and
//! reviewed. A bound that lives only as a literal inside a read loop cannot be any of those.
//!
//! # Why this is a declaration check rather than an unbounded-read detector
//!
//! No source scan can decide whether a read is bounded. The bound may be a `MAX_*` const, the
//! width of a length field (`db2` and `mssql` are safe only because their length is a `u16`),
//! a third-party codec (`postgresql` is bounded by pgwire's own `max_size` check), or the fact
//! that a body is never read at all (`npm`, `oci_registry` and `rss` drop `Incoming` unread).
//! Each of those is correct and none of them looks alike.
//!
//! So the rule is the one thing a scan *can* enforce: every protocol either declares a number
//! or appears below with a reason a human wrote. The baseline is the work queue, and the
//! reasons are what stop it from becoming an exemption list — an entry saying "fixed-size
//! datagram, the buffer is the bound" is a finished answer, and an entry saying "unbounded,
//! reported" is not.
//!
//! # Why a source scan rather than a registry walk
//!
//! The same reason as `decision_tag_ratchet_test` and `event_emit_sites_test`: a registry walk
//! only sees the protocols compiled into that build, and the blocking CI job compiles 6 of 116.
//! Reading `src/server/*/actions.rs` holds at every feature set.
//!
//! Run with:
//!   ./cargo-isolated.sh test --no-default-features --features tcp \
//!       --test max_inbound_bytes_declaration_test

/// Server protocols that do not declare `max_inbound_bytes`, each with the reason.
///
/// **Shrink-only.** Removing an entry is the work; adding one is not an option. A new protocol
/// that reads a peer-chosen number of bytes declares its bound.
///
/// The reasons fall into six kinds, and the difference between them matters — three are
/// finished answers and three are open work:
///
/// 1. **Fixed-size read** — one `recv_from` into one fixed buffer, contents moved into an event
///    and dropped. The allocation is a compile-time constant, so a declaration would be a knob
///    that does nothing. *Finished.*
/// 2. **Delegates** — the BLE profiles have no read loop; `BluetoothBle` owns the radio.
///    *Finished.*
/// 3. **Structural** — the peer's length field is a `u16` or narrower, so the type is the
///    ceiling. Worth knowing rather than declaring, because there is no constant to move.
///    *Finished, but see the note below.*
/// 4. **Third-party bound** — a crate checks the declared length before buffering. *Finished*
///    where the check was actually read; the entry says which line.
/// 5. **Body never read** — the request body is dropped rather than collected, so there is
///    nothing to bound. *Finished.*
/// 6. **Unbounded** — a real defect, named here so it is visible rather than absent.
///    *Open work.*
///
/// A note on kind 3: "the type is the bound" is the weakest of the finished answers, because it
/// is invisible at the read site. `dot` records this in its own source — an earlier
/// `dns_len > 65535` guard was dead code "and read as a bound that was not there". If one of
/// these grows a wider length field, nothing here will notice.
