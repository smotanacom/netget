//! `event_handlers` must reject configuration that cannot work, at parse time.
//!
//! Both shapes below were silently accepted, and both cost a full round of protocol-level
//! debugging before the real cause surfaced. They are exactly what an LLM writing handlers
//! gets wrong, because in both cases the configuration looks entirely reasonable.
//!
//! 1. **An unknown key.** `EventHandler` has exactly two fields and matches on the event id
//!    alone -- there is no data-based matching. An `event_data_contains` key is a natural
//!    thing to assume exists, and it used to be accepted and ignored, so every rule
//!    registered against one event id matched every occurrence and first-match-wins picked
//!    the first. A zookeeper test wrote five such rules to answer five different requests;
//!    the `create` rule answered all of them, and the client failed with `MarshallingError`
//!    from a reply with the wrong body.
//!
//! 2. **A script whose entry point contradicts its `resident` flag.** A resident script
//!    defines `handle(event_type, event, message)`; a non-resident one reads stdin and
//!    prints its own output. Define `handle` without `resident: true` and the script
//!    produces nothing at all, the handler yields no actions, and the server fails closed --
//!    which the peer sees as a generic protocol error naming nothing.
