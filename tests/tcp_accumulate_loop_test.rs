//! The accumulate loop must consume its queue.
//!
//! `handle_data_with_actions` queues data that arrives while an event is being
//! handled, then loops to process it. The payload was bound outside that loop
//! and the queue was never drained, so a single line of input produced an
//! endless stream of identical responses — one model call per iteration,
//! forever. tcp, tls, socket_file and quic all shared the shape.
//!
//! This drives the real server with a static handler (no model involved) and a
//! client that writes twice in quick succession, which is what fills the queue.
