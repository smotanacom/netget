//! An example the model copies must be generated from the bytes, not transcribed from them.
//!
//! Four of the five BLE HID profiles shipped report descriptors that a real host rejects. In
//! **two of them the Rust const was correct and the example had drifted** — someone had pasted
//! the descriptor into the startup example, the const was later fixed, and the example was not.
//!
//! That asymmetry is what makes this worth a build gate rather than a review note. A wrong
//! const is a bug in NetGet, and NetGet's own tests can catch it. A wrong *example* is a bug in
//! what the model is told to do, and there is nothing downstream to catch it: the model copies
//! the example verbatim onto a real device, the host rejects the descriptor, and every layer
//! in between reports success. `hex::encode(HID_MOUSE_REPORT_DESCRIPTOR)` cannot drift; the
//! transcription always can.
//!
//! # The rule, in two limbs
//!
//! A "long hex literal" is a string literal of **more than 16 bytes** (over 32 hex characters)
//! that is entirely hex digits. Below that it is a MAC address, a short magic, an 8-byte
//! sequence number — things a person can read and check. Above it, nobody proofreads.
//!
//! **Limb A — no long hex literal in `get_startup_examples()`.** That body is the text the
//! model imitates when it starts a server, so a literal there is copied straight onto the wire.
//!
//! **Limb B — no long hex literal anywhere in an `actions.rs` whose protocol directory declares
//! a `const … : &[u8]`.** This is the HID case exactly: once the canonical bytes exist as a
//! const, any hex spelling of bytes in the same protocol is a second copy of something that
//! already has one home. The fix is `hex::encode(THE_CONST)`, which is what all five BLE
//! profiles now do.
//!
//! Limb B's baseline is **empty**, and that is the point of it: twelve protocols declare a
//! `&[u8]` const today (the five BLE HID profiles, `finger`, `git`, `rdp`, `tor_relay`,
//! `usb/smartcard`, `vnc`, and the `nfc` client) and not one of them has a long hex literal
//! beside it. The gate holds that line.
//!
//! Run with:
//!   ./cargo-isolated.sh test --no-default-features --features tcp --test example_hex_drift_test

/// **Every entry below has been reviewed against its protocol's source** (22 September 2026).
/// Nothing here is a to-do waiting for someone to look; each line says which of three kinds it
/// is and why it stays. Three kinds, because that is what the review actually found:
///
/// 1. **An opaque identifier the caller supplies.** A 20-byte BitTorrent info hash, a
///    Mercurial changeset node id, a 32-byte block hash: fixed-width identifiers whose
///    canonical text form *is* their hex. There is nothing for them to drift from — no const,
///    no derivation, no structure a model could read instead — and a model cannot get them
///    wrong in a way structure would fix, because any value is as valid as any other.
/// 2. **A deliberate escape hatch whose contract is raw bytes.** Verified in each case, not
///    taken on the description's word: the action says it is the escape hatch, a *structured*
///    sibling exists and is reachable, and the executor really `hex::decode`s the field.
///    (That last check is the `send_tcp_data` bug — documented as accepting hex while the
///    executor did `data.as_bytes()`. None of these has it.)
/// 3. **A wire blob with neither excuse.** A frame or packet the model is expected to
///    assemble, with no structured alternative and nothing to copy it from. These are defects
///    and get fixed rather than recorded.
///
/// The review found kind 3 in `icmp` and `ssh_agent` and **fixed both**, which is why they are
/// no longer here. In `ssh_agent` the fix found a live bug: its two advertised blobs each
/// declared more bytes than they supplied — 32 promised and 3 given for an ed25519 key,
/// 64 promised and 4 given for a signature — so a client reading either walks off the end.
/// That is the defect this whole file exists to catch, sitting in a limb-C entry.
///
/// ## Kind 1 — opaque identifiers, staying
///
/// * **`A:mercurial:actions.rs:20`, `C:mercurial:actions.rs:20`** — `hg_heads` / `hg_branchmap`
///   / `hg_listkeys` and the startup example, all carrying `1234567890abcdef…`, a 40-character
///   changeset node id. The parameter description *requires* exactly 40 hex characters and
///   tells the model to write them out rather than elide them.
/// * **`A:torrent_dht:actions.rs:20`, `C:torrent_dht:actions.rs:20`** — `send_ping_response`
///   and friends, and the startup script: 20-byte DHT node ids and info hashes.
/// * **`C:torrent_peer:actions.rs:20`** — `send_handshake`'s `info_hash` and `peer_id_hex`.
/// * **`C:torrent_tracker:actions.rs:20`** — `send_announce_response` / `send_scrape_response`:
///   info hashes and a peer id (`2d5452303030312d…` is the ASCII `-TR0001-xxxxxxxxxxxx`).
///   Note the comments beside these three: the concrete hex is *deliberate*, replacing a
///   `{{event.info_hash}}` template that only interpolates for static handlers, so on the LLM
///   path the executor received the literal braces, dropped the entry and answered 200 OK with
///   nothing in it. Reverting to a placeholder would reintroduce a known silent failure.
/// * **`C:bitcoin:actions.rs:32`** (the *client*) — `00000000839a8e68…` is the real hash of
///   Bitcoin block 1 and `f4184fc596403b9d…` the first-ever BTC transaction id. Block hashes
///   and txids are 32-byte identifiers; hex is how the whole ecosystem writes them.
/// * **`C:nfc:actions.rs:20`** — `set_atr`'s ATR, `3B8F8001804F0CA0000003060300030000000068`.
///   This is the PC/SC standard ATR for a contactless card, and ISO 7816-3 defines an ATR *as*
///   bytes, including the trailing XOR check character (0x68, which verifies). Its own
///   parameter description already says hex is the only faithful form, and the executor
///   decodes it through `parse_hex` and refuses an empty result.
///
/// ## Kind 2 — escape hatches, verified, staying
///
/// * **`C:ntp:actions.rs:56`** — `send_ntp_response`. Description opens "Escape hatch:" and
///   names `send_ntp_time_response` as the thing to prefer; that sibling is in the same
///   `get_sync_actions` list and fills in the header and echoes the origin timestamp. The
///   executor strips separators, refuses odd-length and non-hex with an error naming the
///   field, and refuses under 48 bytes. No `as_bytes()` path exists.
/// * **`C:bitcoin:actions.rs:24`** (the *server*) — `send_bitcoin_message`. Description opens
///   "ESCAPE HATCH - prefer send_version/send_verack/…"; all five of those siblings exist and
///   are reachable. The executor `hex::decode`s. The 24 bytes are a correct mainnet verack
///   (magic `f9beb4d9`, command padded to 12, length 0, checksum `5df6e0e2` = the first four
///   bytes of the double-SHA256 of the empty payload).
/// * **`C:hls:actions.rs:21`** — `hls_segment_response`. This one is the *remedy* already
///   applied: it carries an explicit `encoding` field ("utf8" default, "hex"), never sniffed,
///   exactly as `send_tcp_data` settled it, and the example exists to show the hex path with
///   genuine MPEG-TS bytes (`0x47` sync byte, PID 0, a PAT).
///
/// ## Kind 3 — defects, all fixed; nothing in this file is outstanding
///
/// Every entry in the baseline is kind 1 or kind 2 — a recorded decision, not a to-do. The
/// kind-3 findings were `icmp` and `ssh_agent` (above), and three more in `src/client/` that
/// this file carried as "still work" for one pass and that were fixed on 22 September 2026:
///
/// * **`A:socks5:actions.rs:37`, `A:tor:actions.rs:37`** — the same 37 bytes in both,
///   `474554202f20485454502f312e310d0a…`, which is `GET / HTTP/1.1` and a `Host:` header
///   hex-encoded into the static-mode startup example. The model was shown a request it could
///   not read, adapt to another host or path, or check; `send_socks5_data` and `send_tor_data`
///   declared only `data_hex`, and both executors `hex::decode`d it unconditionally.
///
///   Both now take `data` plus an explicit `encoding` ("utf8" by default, or "hex") — the
///   `send_tcp_data` shape — and every example is the request spelled out. `data_hex` is
///   still **accepted** by both executors so an existing static handler or stored prompt
///   keeps working, is no longer advertised, and supplying it together with `data` is refused
///   rather than resolved by precedence.
///
///   The inbound events changed with them, because an event field the model cannot read is
///   the same defect wearing the other hat: `socks5_data_received` and `tor_data_received`
///   carried `data_hex` only, so even a plain HTTP response arrived as hex. They now carry
///   `data` + `encoding` + `data_length`, which hand straight back to the send action.
/// * **`C:datalink:actions.rs:42`** — `inject_frame`'s example was an ARP request as 42 bytes
///   of hex, on the action and on two event types. An Ethernet frame is genuinely structured,
///   so it got structure rather than an encoding flag: `dst_mac`, `src_mac`, `ethertype` (a
///   name such as `"arp"`, a number, or `"0x0806"` — a bare `"0806"` is refused, because it
///   is 2054 read as hex and 806 read as decimal and only the caller knows which) and an
///   optional `payload` whose `payload_encoding` is **required**. Required, not defaulted to
///   "utf8" like `send_tcp_data`'s: an Ethernet payload is binary far more often than text,
///   so a utf8 default would put the ASCII characters of an ARP body on the wire for exactly
///   the frames a model is most likely to build.
///
///   `frame_hex` stays, as the escape hatch — `datalink_frame_captured` hands the model
///   exactly that, and replaying or amending a captured frame is a real thing to want — and
///   the two spellings cannot be combined. Both frame events gained the same fields, so a
///   captured frame is readable instead of being hex for the model to slice in its head.
///
/// What did not change is the threshold, and the rule that a long hex literal is a defect
/// until someone writes down which of the three kinds it is. All three above were found by
/// this ratchet rather than by reading.
