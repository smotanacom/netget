//! A caller that writes its requests and closes stdin must still get every answer.
//!
//! rmcp's serve loop stops the moment its input ends, and a tool call still being handled at that
//! moment has its response dropped. `netget --mcp` wraps its stdio transport in
//! `mcp_stdio::drain::DrainOnEof`, which reports the end of input only once every request it
//! received has been answered. This drives both transports over in-memory pipes with the same
//! bytes a shell pipeline sends: `initialize`, `initialized`, one `tools/call`, then EOF.
//!
//! The runtime is single-threaded on purpose. There the loop sees the end of input before the
//! spawned tool handler has run at all, so the unwrapped transport loses the answer every time
//! (the control) rather than only when a race goes the wrong way, and the wrapped one keeps it
//! because waiting for the answer is what lets the handler run.
