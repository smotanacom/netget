//! Regression guard: a packet-capture server must never report `Running` while capturing
//! nothing.
//!
//! ARP, DataLink and ICMP each shipped a `spawn()` that fired the privileged open off inside
//! `tokio::task::spawn_blocking` and returned `Ok(..)` before the result was known. On a machine
//! without `/dev/bpf*` access (macOS/BSD) or `CAP_NET_RAW` (Linux) the blocking task logged an
//! error and returned, while `server_startup` had already recorded `ServerStatus::Running`. The
//! user saw a healthy server that could not possibly see a packet. All three were fixed
//! individually — and **IS-IS, which has exactly the same shape, was missed each time**. This
//! file exists so the fourth recurrence is a failing test rather than another audit finding.
//!
//! The invariant under test is not "capture works" (that needs privileges nobody has in CI); it
//! is the far cheaper and far more important one: **`spawn()` must not return `Ok` unless the
//! privileged resource is genuinely open.** Both branches are asserted, so the test has teeth
//! whether or not the runner is privileged:
//!
//! * privileged  → `spawn()` returns `Ok` and the capture is live;
//! * unprivileged → `spawn()` returns `Err` naming the resource that could not be opened.
//!
//! A regression to fire-and-forget fails the unprivileged branch immediately, which is the
//! branch every developer machine and every CI runner takes.
//!
//! No Ollama is needed: nothing here gets far enough to emit an event.
//!
//! ```bash
//! cargo test --no-default-features --features arp,datalink,isis,icmp \
//!   --test capture_startup_reports_failure_test -- --test-threads=100
//! ```
