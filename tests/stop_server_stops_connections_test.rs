//! Stopping a server must stop its **in-flight connections**, not just its listener.
//!
//! The root `CLAUDE.md` recorded this as a known systemic issue: "Per-connection tasks are
//! untracked, so `stop_server` does not cancel in-flight connections." A measurement on
//! 15 September 2026 put numbers on it — 301 `tokio::spawn` calls across `src/server/*/mod.rs`
//! against 159 `register_server_task` calls, in 102 protocols. The shape is consistent: the
//! accept loop is the handle a protocol remembers to register, and the connection it just
//! accepted is the one it forgets.
//!
//! What that costs is worse than a leak. A stopped server released its listening socket, so it
//! *looked* stopped — the port was free, the instance was gone from state — while every
//! connection already open kept reading, kept calling the model and kept answering. The
//! operator had no way to tell, and no way to stop it short of killing the process.
//!
//! `AppState::spawn_server_task` is the fix: spawn and register in one call, so the easy path
//! is the correct one. These tests are the contract, asserted in-process against the live
//! `AppState` rather than through a subprocess, so they can see the handle vector itself.
//!
//! Run with:
//!   ./cargo-isolated.sh test --no-default-features --features tcp \
//!       --test stop_server_stops_connections_test -- --test-threads=100
