//! Three shrink-only ratchets over the test suite itself.

//! The suite is the evidence for every maturity rating in this repository. Where the suite

//!
//! Each check reads the source tree, so it holds at the six-protocol CI gate as well as at
//! `--all-features`: a registry-walking test only ever sees what that build compiled, and 110
//! of the 116 protocols are not in the blocking job.

// 1. A reason on every `#[ignore]`
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

/// A bare `#[ignore]` is a test that has been switched off for a reason nobody wrote down.
///
/// That matters more here than in most repositories, because an ignore in this tree is load
/// bearing: it is what stands between a protocol's maturity rating and the evidence that
/// rating claims. `CLAUDE.md` records the MQTT case — four pub/sub tests sat behind stale
/// "MQTT broker not yet implemented" markers inside a `/* … */` block, so nothing even
/// compiled them, and a working broker was held at Experimental for months. A reason string
/// is the cheapest thing that makes that visible: `cargo test` prints it next to the test
/// name, so a stale one is read rather than inherited.
///
/// The reason must say what is missing (a binary, an adapter, root, a real model) rather than
/// that the test is "flaky" or "broken" — those are defects to investigate, not reasons.
///
/// **Baseline: zero, and it may only stay that way.** 105 bare attributes were converted in
/// September 2026; 97 had the reason sitting in a trailing `//` comment where no test runner
/// would ever show it, and 8 had nothing at all.

// 2. No fixed second-scale sleeps in a protocol suite
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

/// Files that may still contain `sleep(Duration::from_secs(N))`, with how many.
///
/// A fixed sleep is a guess about how long something will take, and this repository has
/// measured what that guess is worth: `m3ua`'s suite went from 6s to 0.46s when three of them
/// became waits, and every "load-flaky" test investigated in `CLAUDE.md` — the doh keychain
/// stall, the port-0 probe race — was first noticed because a constant that was generous
/// alone was not generous at `--test-threads=100`.
///
/// The helpers that replace one are `wait_for_mocks`, `wait_for_any`, `wait_for_log`,
/// `wait_for_pattern`, `wait_for_regex` and `wait_for_server_listening`.
///
/// **Two kinds of entry below are legitimate and are expected to stay:**
///
/// * **The sleep is the thing under test.** `client/stomp` sleeps 30s to prove a silent broker
///   times out rather than hanging; `server/turn` sleeps past an allocation's lifetime;
///   `client/bgp`'s hold-timer and update tests sleep to prove that nothing happens. You
///   cannot wait on the absence of an event.
/// * **The sleep is a settle *after* a condition.** Waiting on a counter that is bumped before
///   the decision it guards leaves a real window; `tuntap`'s `wait_for_received` documents
///   exactly this. Keep those and say so in a comment.
///
/// Everything else on this list is a guess that has not been converted yet — most of it in
/// tests that are `#[ignore]`d for an external dependency and so never run. **The counts may
/// only shrink**, and a file that reaches zero comes off the list entirely.
