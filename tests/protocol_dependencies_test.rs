//! The protocol dependency mechanism must actually report something.
//!
//! `get_excluded_protocols()` is called from the event handler (`src/events/handler.rs`) and the
//! TUI sticky footer, and both render whatever it returns. It was fully plumbed and completely
//! inert: not one protocol overrode `Protocol::get_dependencies()`, whose default returned an
//! empty vector, so the exclusion map was always empty and the feature did nothing.
//!
//! The default now derives from `metadata().privilege_requirement` — one declaration, two
//! consumers, nothing to drift. These tests pin that it is live, and that the derivation maps
//! each privilege onto the dependency that is actually checked.
//!
//! Note the two consumers differ in force: `privilege_requirement` hard-gates startup in
//! `server_startup.rs`, while dependencies are informational. Nothing here should be read as
//! blocking a protocol.
