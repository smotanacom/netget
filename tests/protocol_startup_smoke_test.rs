//! Integration smoke test: every registered server protocol must start HONESTLY.
//!
//! The per-protocol E2E suites exercise one protocol in isolation against a mocked
//! LLM. This test does the opposite: it walks the *whole* server registry and drives
//! each protocol through the real startup path (`cli::server_startup::
//! start_server_from_action`), the same one the TUI, the `open_server` action and the
//! MCP `start_server` tool use. It asserts nothing about protocol behaviour — only
//! that starting, reporting and stopping tell the truth.
//!
//! ## What counts as a failure
//!
//! * **`LiedAboutListening`** — the single most important case. `spawn()` returned a
//!   concrete `SocketAddr`, `server_startup` recorded `ServerStatus::Running` and set
//!   `local_addr`, and yet the port is free: nothing is bound. This exact bug has been
//!   found four separate times in this repo (`arp`, `datalink`, `icmp`, `isis`, all of
//!   which used fire-and-forget `spawn_blocking` and never awaited readiness).
//! * **`Hang`** — `spawn()` did not return within `START_TIMEOUT`. A start that never
//!   comes back is a defect regardless of what it was waiting for.
//! * **`Panicked`** — `spawn()` unwound. Startup params, missing devices and absent
//!   privileges must all produce `Err`, never a panic.
//! * **`PortLeak`** — after `remove_server()` the socket is still held. Almost always a
//!   missing `AppState::register_server_task()` in `spawn()`: dropping a Tokio
//!   `JoinHandle` merely detaches the task, so the accept loop keeps the port until
//!   process exit.
//! * **`ExternalHostDefault`** — the protocol's `default_binding()` names a host that
//!   is not loopback or a wildcard. Such a protocol is not started at all: a smoke test
//!   must never touch the network.
//!
//! ## What does not count as a failure
//!
//! * **`RefusedCleanly`** — `Err` with a message, promptly. This is the correct outcome
//!   for a protocol needing raw sockets, packet capture, a TUN device or a hardware
//!   device this machine lacks, and for one whose default interface does not exist
//!   here (`lo` is Linux; macOS calls it `lo0`). Refusing is not skipping — the reason
//!   is recorded in the report and can be reviewed.
//! * **`RunningNoSocket`** — `Running` with no bound socket. Legitimate for genuinely
//!   socketless protocols (WebRTC is peer-to-peer; Bluetooth, USB and NFC speak to a
//!   device), and `server_startup::is_bound_addr` already declines to advertise an
//!   endpoint for them. It is reported as a distinct bucket rather than a pass,
//!   because it is the one bucket this test cannot verify.
//! * **`RunningUnverifiable`** — `Running` with an address that is not a local
//!   endpoint and so cannot be probed. Probing such an address says nothing about
//!   NetGet — on a machine where anything else has joined the same multicast group (a
//!   stray `zeroconf` process is enough) it reads as held whether or not NetGet is
//!   running, which would produce both false passes and false port-leak reports.
//!   **No protocol lands here any more.** mDNS did: it reported the `224.0.0.251:5353`
//!   multicast *group* it announces on as though it were its endpoint. It now returns
//!   the `0.0.0.0:0` "no listening socket" placeholder like every other socketless
//!   protocol and shows up as `RunningNoSocket`, with the group reported on the status
//!   stream where it belongs (`src/server/mdns/mod.rs`). The bucket stays because the
//!   distinction is real and the next protocol to make that mistake should be named,
//!   not silently passed.
//!
//! ## Isolation
//!
//! * The LLM client points at `http://127.0.0.1:1` — connection-refused on the first
//!   packet. No model is contacted, and no external endpoint of any kind is.
//! * Port `0` is requested for every port-based protocol, so each start gets an
//!   ephemeral loopback port.
//! * Protocols run one at a time, each torn down before the next starts, so a protocol
//!   that ignores the requested port and binds a fixed one cannot collide with another.
//!
//! ## Running it
//!
//! ```bash
//! ./cargo-isolated.sh test --all-features --test protocol_startup_smoke_test \
//!     -- --test-threads=100 --nocapture
//! ```
//!
//! `--all-features` is the point: with fewer features the registry is smaller and the
//! sweep says correspondingly less. Set `NETGET_SMOKE_REPORT=<path>` to also write the
//! full table to a file. Set `NETGET_SMOKE_ONLY=<name>[,<name>...]` to sweep a subset
//! while debugging one protocol.

/// loopback port must come back **promptly and without unwinding**. Hanging and
/// panicking are the two failures; everything else is recorded and reported.
///
/// Deliberately *not* asserted: that `connect()` returns `Err`. About half the client
/// protocols return `Ok` here, and for most that is a legitimate design rather than a
/// lie — a datagram client (DNS, UDP, SNMP, NTP, syslog…) has no handshake to fail, and
/// several request/response clients build a lazily-connecting handle (`reqwest`, the
/// MongoDB driver) whose first real I/O happens later. `Client::connect` has no
/// documented contract that it must reach the peer, so failing the build on that would
/// be inventing one. The report prints the split so the ambiguity stays visible instead
/// of being either asserted away or silently passed.
///
/// Note the documented limitation this test cannot cover: a client's accept/read loop
/// `JoinHandle` is not stored by every protocol, so `remove_client()` does not always
/// stop the network loop. That is checked for the protocols that do register one in
