# NetGet Protocol Roadmap

Durable tracking for the protocol-expansion programme started September 2026:
what we decided to build, why, and where each item stands.

**This is not a status report.** The root `CLAUDE.md` warns against adding
one-off session/status files — that is what let the root directory reach 63
markdown files. This is one file, updated *in place* as items move, and it is
meant to be edited rather than superseded. If an item lands, change its row;
do not write a new file about it. When every row here reads `landed`, fold the
durable lessons into `CLAUDE.md` and delete this file.

## Programme 2 — complete (13 September 2026)

**All 39 batches are merged and pushed.** Every server and client protocol has had
a pass against the eight-point rubric below. Roughly 200 defects were fixed. The
counts drift; re-derive rather than quoting these.

Promotions earned during the pass: `kubernetes` (server) and `ollama` to `Beta`,
each on evidence that was checked rather than taken on report. `nfc`'s client went
`Incomplete` → `Experimental` — `Incomplete` makes `is_available_to_llm()` false, so
the model could not see it at all, which contradicted the claim elsewhere that no
`Incomplete` protocols remain.

**The defect classes worth carrying forward**, in rough order of how often they
recurred and how quietly they failed:

| Class | The shape it takes |
|---|---|
| Fail-open default | An omitted field becomes an affirmative answer. NFC and usb-smartcard both defaulted an APDU status word to `90 00`, in two layers each, so an *omission approved an authentication*. |
| Narrowing cast | `as u16` on a model- or wire-supplied number. `65736 as u16 == 200`. It turned refusals into successes, and in Modbus it turned a typo into a plausible *fail-closed* answer — the first instance to land on the safety mechanism itself. |
| A test that encodes the bug | The BLE HID descriptors, the GATT UUID keying, and one bcdHID assertion were all *documented as the interface*. A green suite proves nothing when the only real parser lives on someone else's machine. |
| An advertised knob that does nothing | `send_first` in seven servers; `auto_advertise` in the BLE base; every BLE sensor profile's script-mode example, which assigned a local and printed nothing so the event fell back to the LLM. |
| A bound decided by configuration rather than by the answer | tuntap skipped its LLM budget whenever a script handler was *configured*, but the executor falls back to the model when the language is missing — so the shipped example on a box without `python3` was one uncounted model call per packet at wire rate. |
| Unbounded pre-auth input | Request bodies, URB assembly buffers, TLV walks. usb-fido2 reserved up to 64 KiB from one 64-byte packet, on unlimited channels, indefinitely. |
| A client that reaches the vendor instead of the target | The `openai` client fell back to real OpenAI with the operator's key; the `openapi` client took its base URL from a model-supplied spec ahead of the operator's address. |

Two things that made these findable and are worth keeping: **agents stayed inside
their boundaries and reported across them** (the NFC → usb-smartcard handover, the
`bluetooth_ble_presenter` ownership gap), and **every promotion was re-derived from
the evidence rather than accepted from a summary**.

## Where Programme 1 stood (4 September 2026)

**All 30 protocols have landed**: 8 servers, 8 clients, 14 root/privileged. Four
are `Beta`; the other 26 are `Experimental`, each with its *reason* recorded
rather than a hedge.

Verified after the last one landed:

| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| `--features all-protocols` compile | clean (3 pre-existing lib warnings, none in the new 30) |
| Full suite, `--test-threads=100` | **1265 server + 360 client = 1625 passed, 0 failed** |
| Six whole-tree ratchets, at `all-protocols` | 29 passed, 0 failed |
| Orphaned test directories | none, either tree |
| New `#[cfg(test)]` under `src/` | none — the five pre-existing files are unchanged |
| `cargo fmt --check` | clean tree-wide |
| `/Users/matus/bin/netget` | rebuilt with `all-protocols` and reinstalled |

**Three test-deadline defects were found only by the full sweep**, all the same
shape: asserting a condition while waiting on something that happens *earlier*.
Two in `tuntap` (waiting on an arrival counter plus a fixed 120 ms settle, then
asserting a decision) and one in `gtp` (waiting for the model to be called, then
asserting on a log line written after its answer is handled). Each passes alone
in under a second at any feature set — which is exactly why the root `CLAUDE.md`
says passing in isolation tells you the *deadline* was wrong, not that the code
is fine. No assertion was changed; only what each waits for. GTP's wire
assertions had already passed, so its protocol behaviour was provably correct
and only the log line was in flight.

One failure seen mid-sweep was **`server::webrtc::…data_channel_message_round_trip`**,
which this programme never touched (`git log` confirms) and which passed on the
final run. It is load-flaky and pre-existing, and worth someone's attention:
under load its mock expectations go unmet and it trips the
`Server dropped without calling .verify_mocks()` guard.

## Status legend

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `planned` | Specified below. Nothing exists in the tree. |
| `wired` | Feature flag, module declaration, registry entry and test-module declaration exist. No implementation. |
| `building` | An agent is implementing it right now. |
| `landed` | Committed, compiles, its own tests pass. **Not** a claim about maturity — see below. |
| `blocked` | Needs something that does not exist yet. Reason recorded in the row. |

`landed` and the protocol's `DevelopmentState` are different claims. `landed`
means the code is in. `DevelopmentState` means what the evidence supports, and
the bar for `Beta` is a **real third-party client, not `#[ignore]`d, that
fails rather than skips when the client is missing**. Read the "Protocol
inventory" section of `CLAUDE.md` before promoting anything; three protocols
have been demoted for treating a codec or a skipped test as evidence.

## Environment constraints (measured on this machine, Darwin 27, September 2026)

These decide which items can be validated locally and which cannot. Re-measure
rather than trusting them.

| Fact | Consequence |
|---|---|
| **`feth` driver present** (`net.link.fake.txstart: 1`) | `sudo ifconfig feth0 create && ifconfig feth1 peer feth0` gives a real Ethernet pair with **no hardware**. Every Tier-1 L2 protocol below can be driven end to end locally. |
| **`/dev/bpf*` present** | Capture and injection available under root. |
| **`utun` available** (5 present) | TUN endpoint is viable on macOS. |
| **Multicast on loopback: joining works, *sending* does not** | Measured on macOS 27, and it contradicts the received wisdom that the *join* fails. Bound to `127.0.0.1`, `join_multicast_v4(239.255.255.250)` **succeeds**; `sendto(239.255.255.250:1900)` fails with **`EADDRNOTAVAIL` (49)** because loopback carries no multicast route. Bound to `0.0.0.0` both work. Any multicast protocol therefore needs a unicast target parameter to be observable in a test — do not "fix" a join that is not broken. |
| **No SCTP on macOS** (no headers, no stack) | M3UA/SIGTRAN cannot use its real transport here. See its row. |
| **No `AF_CAN` on macOS** | SocketCAN is Linux-only. Linux `vcan` needs no hardware, so it is testable *there*. |
| **802.11 injection unavailable on macOS** | Monitor mode works, injection effectively does not. Rogue-AP work would be Linux + specific chipset. Deferred. |
| Installed real clients | `curl` (with gopher), `finger`, `nmblookup`, `smbclient`, `whois`, `ffmpeg`, `docker`, `openssl`, `redis-cli`. No `nmbd`/`smbd` daemon, no `nats-server`, no UPnP tools. |

**The wireguard trap applies to everything privileged here.** A protocol that
cannot be started in the environment that tests it cannot be validated, and
`CLAUDE.md` records what happened when one was rated `Stable` anyway. Prefer
the items testable on `feth`/`utun` under sudo; for the Linux-only ones, either
run them in a Linux container in CI or rate them honestly and say why.

## Wave 1 — text and discovery servers

Eight servers. Wiring landed in `2f599954`; each implementation is committed
separately by the agent that wrote it.

| Protocol | Feature | Module | Transport | Privilege | Validation target | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| NATS | `nats` | `nats` | TCP 4222 | none | **`async-nats` 0.50, official client, non-circular (we use no NATS library)** | `landed` (`b5d451ed`) — **Beta** |
| STOMP | `stomp` | `stomp` | TCP 61613 | none | **`async-stomp` 0.6.3** drives a full session and decodes every frame itself | `landed` (`f9b4e946`) — **Beta** |
| Ident | `ident` | `ident` | TCP 113 | `PrivilegedPort(113)` | **none exists** — no RFC 1413 client anywhere takes a configurable port | `landed` (`59a3003b`) — Experimental |
| Gopher | `gopher` | `gopher` | TCP 70 | `PrivilegedPort(70)` | **`curl gopher://` — real, arbitrary port** | `landed` (`a3573323`) — **Beta** |
| Finger | `finger` | `finger` | TCP 79 | `PrivilegedPort(79)` | `finger(1)` confirmed port-locked to 79 → needs root | `landed` (`a28bf0a2`) — Experimental |
| SSDP | `ssdp` | `ssdp` | UDP 1900 mcast | none for the *server*: no Rust SSDP client can be aimed at a unicast loopback port. **This does not generalise — see the correction below** | `landed` (`5cb49c9a`) — Experimental |
| LLMNR | `llmnr` | `llmnr` | UDP 5355 mcast | none | **none** — only LLMNR crate is a responder, not a querier; real clients are Windows/systemd-resolved. Evidence is circular by construction | `landed` (`19ebd0eb`) — Experimental |
| NetBIOS-NS | `netbios-ns` | `netbios_ns` | UDP 137 | `PrivilegedPort(137)` | `nmblookup` 4.24.6 **confirmed port-locked to 137** (`nbt port=` is parsed and ignored by the client; proven with tcpdump). Its captured datagrams pin the *decode* direction; the *response* direction is unvalidated | `landed` (`2901a6e9`) — Experimental |

SSDP, LLMNR and NetBIOS-NS are in the **deliberately-silent** class: every
reply is a positive assertion (a device exists / a name maps to an address), so
on LLM failure they must emit *nothing* and record `decision=` in the log the
way `src/server/radius/` does. A fabricated answer poisons a cache.

---

## Wave 2 — clients

All eight of Wave 1 also get clients. Each reuses its server's **existing
Cargo feature**, so no new feature flags — only `src/protocol/client_registry.rs`,
`src/client/mod.rs` and `tests/client/mod.rs` entries.

**Every one of these is unprivileged even where its server is not.** Sending to
UDP 137 or 1900 from an ephemeral source port needs no privilege; only *binding*
the well-known port does.

| Client | Module | What it does | Validation target | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| SSDP | `ssdp` | M-SEARCH discovery of real UPnP devices; surfaces `LOCATION` but deliberately does **not** fetch it (that would turn discovery into an outbound request to an attacker-controlled URL) | A device **emulator** is a live option — see the correction below | `landed` (`29708887`) — Experimental |
| NetBIOS-NS | `netbios_ns` | `nbtstat` equivalent — name query + node status | **Encode is byte-identical to real `nmblookup` queries** (captured with tcpdump, both `NB` and `NBSTAT`). **Decode has no independent evidence** — see the asymmetry note below | `landed` (`41c35f42`) — Experimental |
| NATS | `nats` | Joins a real NATS fabric; LLM reacts to live messages and publishes | **`nats-server` v2.14.6 routes and `async-nats` requests — independent implementations on *both* sides** | `landed` (`a982ccc1`) — **Beta** |
| Ident | `ident` | Queries a remote identd — what an IRC server does. Makes the existing `irc` server able to do genuine ident lookups | **None, structurally**: RFC 1413 has no configurable port, so nothing can be aimed at an ephemeral one | `landed` (`bec74f5d`) — Experimental |
| LLMNR | `llmnr` | Resolves a name via LLMNR multicast; collects a whole window and raises `llmnr_conflicting_responses` when responders disagree | Real Windows / systemd-resolved hosts. **`llmnr-poison` considered and declined — see below** | `landed` (`f415efb4`) — Experimental |
| STOMP | `stomp` | Same shape as NATS, against ActiveMQ/RabbitMQ | Needs a real broker. **The two assertions that would catch a buggy client past a lenient one are written down** in `src/client/stomp/AGENTS.md` | `landed` (`702eb22f`) — Experimental |
| Gopher | `gopher` | Browses gopherspace; LLM navigates menus | **`geomyidae`/`gophernicus`/`pygopherd` all bind an ordinary port and run fine on loopback** — the external-endpoint ban was never the blocker; none is installed, and a hard-fail (not skip) test would earn Beta | `landed` (`be405db9`) — Experimental |
| Finger | `finger` | Queries a remote finger daemon; **does not parse the response** (RFC 1288 specifies no format) — raw text to the model, with any scraped field marked `GUESS ONLY` | No packaged daemon anywhere (no Homebrew formula for `bsd-finger`/`fingerd`/`netkit`), but a daemon *can* bind a high port, so Beta is achievable in principle | `landed` (`e3f58a57`) — Experimental |

**Evidence can be asymmetric, and the rating must follow the weaker half.**
The NetBIOS-NS client is the worked example: its *encoder* is independently
pinned — the queries it generates are byte-identical to ones real `nmblookup`
4.24.6 puts on the wire — while its *decoder* has met no responder but our own.
It stayed `Experimental`, because Beta's claim is "works against real clients"
and the unproven direction is the one that matters. Note what was *not* done:
stepping down one notch into a rating the same evidence also rules out, which is
the `wireguard` error `CLAUDE.md` records.

Two practical notes from that work, both worth reusing: `tcpdump -i lo0` needs
only `access_bpf` group membership, not root, so capturing a real client's
datagrams is available here; and **hand-transcribing encoded NetBIOS names does
not work** — a 30-character run of `A`s was copied wrong twice, once a byte long
and once a byte short, and both failures read exactly like an encoder bug.
Generate such literals from the pcap with a script.

**Dependency decision: `llmnr-poison` was evaluated and declined (September 2026).**
It is a genuine independent LLMNR encoder — a pure function, depending only on
`anyhow` and `tokio`, so it hand-rolls the DNS wire format and shares no codec
with us. That would have broken the *codec* axis of the LLMNR client's circular
evidence. It was declined anyway, on two grounds that both have to be weighed:

- **Supply chain.** v0.1.0, published three weeks earlier, single author,
  offensive-security purpose, and its stated repository (`icedracon/llmnr-poison`)
  returns 404. A dev-dependency still executes on every developer's machine and in
  CI.
- **It would not have changed the rating.** The *same-project* axis remains — our
  own responder is still the peer — and an independent response *encoder* is not a
  running responder. The protocol stays `Experimental` either way.

A dependency that carries real risk and buys no evidence is a bad trade. If it
matures, has a real repository, and someone wants the codec axis broken, revisit
it — but the rating argument will still not hold on its own.

**A correction worth carrying, from the SSDP pair.** The server-side finding —
"no Rust SSDP crate can be aimed at a unicast loopback port" — is about crates
that *search*, i.e. control points. **It does not generalise to the client half**,
which needs a peer that *answers*, and a device replies to wherever the search
came from. So a device emulator is a live option for the client even though a
client crate was not for the server. Check which *role* a missing-peer finding
applies to before reusing it; the two halves of a protocol have different needs.

**Wave 2 is complete — all eight clients landed.** Seven are `Experimental`
because their only peer is NetGet's own server (same-project evidence: it shows
the two halves agree, not that either matches the spec). **NATS is the exception
and the template**: the official `nats-server` routes while `async-nats`
requests, so both sides are independent implementations.

A pattern worth copying from the STOMP client: rather than just recording "a real
broker would earn Beta", it wrote down **the two specific assertions a lenient
broker would let a buggy client past** — that the delivery was *acknowledged*
rather than redelivered (catching an `ACK` that quotes `message_id` instead of
the `ack` header), and that the session closed on the `RECEIPT` rather than on
the grace timeout. A "what would earn Beta" note is far more useful when it names
the assertions than when it names the software.

Client-specific rules that have bitten this repo before, from `CLAUDE.md`:

- **Do not throw away the model's answer.** The single most common client
  defect, found in six protocols in one pass: `let _ = result.actions`, a bare
  `debug!` of `.len()`, or executing follow-ups through a path that raises no
  event. Box the recursive call and cap it (`MAX_FOLLOWUP_DEPTH`, 4–8).
- **Clients union their action sets** — `client_llm_action_set` is
  async ∪ sync ∪ the firing event's actions. A client cannot express a
  narrowing, so do not try.
- Register **every** spawned task, not just the read loop (BGP's keepalive
  timer kept a socket alive after `remove_client()`).
- Adopt `command_support::register_command_channel` so the dashboard `[send]`
  works, and register it **before** any call that might park on a connect event.

## Wave 3 — root and privileged protocols

Thirteen protocols. This is the tier the maintainer considers most interesting,
and the tier where the wireguard trap is most dangerous.

### Tier 1 — L2 impersonation ("NetGet as a rogue switch")

All raw-Ethernet, all `PrivilegeRequirement::RawSockets`, all testable locally
on a `feth` pair under sudo. Pairs with existing `arp` / `datalink` / `isis`,
and shares their `pnet` dependency.

| Protocol | Feature | Module | Wire | What the model decides | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| LLDP | `lldp` | `lldp` | EtherType 0x88CC, dest `01:80:C2:00:00:0E` | Chassis/port/system TLVs — impersonate a switch to its neighbour | `landed` (`5e87ba2a`) — Experimental |
| CDP | `cdp` | `cdp` | SNAP, dest `01:00:0C:CC:CC:CC` | Device model, IOS version, native VLAN — the classic recon leak | `planned` |
| STP/RSTP | `stp` | `stp` | 802.3 LLC, dest `01:80:C2:00:00:00` | Bridge priority. Claiming root bridge is a real attack | `landed` (`c4090e37`) — Experimental |
| VRRP + CARP | `vrrp` | `vrrp` | IP proto 112, mcast `224.0.0.18` | Election priority — winning it hijacks the default gateway | `landed` (`88e12101`) — Experimental |
| HSRP | `hsrp` | `hsrp` | UDP 1985, mcast `224.0.0.2` | Same, Cisco's version. **Unprivileged, so the transport genuinely executes** — no HSRP crate exists in any role; only a Cisco device is a real peer | `landed` (`28781187`) — Experimental |
| EAPOL / 802.1X | `eapol` | `eapol` | EtherType 0x888E | Authenticator role. **The strictest fail-closed design here** — see below | `landed` (`5e05313a`) — Experimental |
| Wake-on-LAN | `wol` | `wol` | UDP 9 (or EtherType 0x0842) | Whether a magic packet is honoured, and what is reported | `landed` (`4da604c9`) — Experimental |

**A design consequence LLDP surfaced, which applies to every raw-socket protocol
here.** `privilege_requirement` is a *static* property of the protocol, so a
protocol honestly declaring `RawSockets` is refused by `server_startup` on an
unprivileged host **even when started in UDP test mode**. The test transport is
therefore reachable by calling `Server::spawn` directly — which is what the
suites do, following `bluetooth_ble_beacon` — and not through
`open_server`/MCP. Declaring `None` to dodge that would be a lie about the
transport anyone actually uses, so do not. If this becomes a real obstacle, the
fix is a dynamic privilege check in `server_startup`, not a false declaration.

**VRRP/CARP and HSRP are split deliberately.** VRRP and CARP share a transport
(IP protocol 112) and semantics, so one module with a `variant` startup
parameter is honest. HSRP is UDP — a different transport — and forcing it into
the same module would mean one protocol with two socket types.

**EAPOL is the highest-value item in this tier**: with the existing `radius`
server it forms a complete NAC lab — EAPOL on the wire → RADIUS → the model
decides admission. Build it after or alongside a review of `src/server/radius/`,
whose fail-closed design it must match. An 802.1X authenticator that fails open
is an authentication bypass, which is exactly the OAuth2 defect `CLAUDE.md`
calls the most dangerous pattern in the codebase.

**Wake-on-LAN privilege note:** the UDP form listens on port 9, which is below
1024 — declare `PrivilegedPort(9)`, not `None`. `CLAUDE.md` records `svn`
declaring `PrivilegedPort(3690)`, which can never fire and read as protection
while being dead code; do not invert that mistake here.

**EAPOL is the reference implementation of fail-closed in this repo now**, and
the technique generalises to any protocol where one message *is* an authorisation.
`EAP-Success` cannot be produced except by an explicit model action, guaranteed
four ways: the registry instance holds no request context so it can encode
nothing; `send_eap_success` is refused unless the session already holds an
`EAP-Response/Identity`; the decision layer re-checks the encoded frame so a
regression in that gate is *reported* rather than served; and — the structural
one — **`eapol_eap_success_frame` and `eapol_eap_failure_frame` are eight literal
octets each and share no code**. There is deliberately no
`encode_eap_result(code, id)`, so no boolean exists that could be inverted. Every
fail-closed exit calls the failure builder directly, never the executor.

When its hand-rolled MD5 was later replaced by the `md-5` crate (`008c7261`),
the RFC 1321 and RFC 1994 vector tests were **kept and re-documented** rather
than deleted with the implementation: they no longer claim to be an oracle for
our digest, they guard our *use* of someone else's. A wrapper that feeds the
hasher the wrong buffer, drops an update, or returns the digest with the wrong
endianness would pass every other test in the file and fail those four. Deleting
vector tests along with a hand-rolled primitive is the reflex to resist.

Its own e2e suite then found a real defect the unit tests could not: the model's
`expected_password` was never recorded, so MD5 verification could never succeed.
Being fail-closed, it presented as a stuck exchange rather than a bypass — which
is the whole argument for building it that way round.

**Two lessons from HSRP worth reusing.** First, **state codes that overlap
across versions with different meanings are a silent-corruption trap**: HSRP code
`4` is *Speak* in v1 and *Standby* in v2, both valid, so a mis-decode produces a
plausible wrong answer rather than an error. The fix was to never let a state
cross a version boundary as an integer, have the model see and produce names
only, and pin it from **both** directions — a test in one direction alone passes
with the bug present.

Second, **the fail-closed logging vocabulary is protocol-shaped, not universal**.
`radius` separates `model_reject` from `model_silent` because it has an
Access-Reject to send. HSRP has no negative message at all, so a refusal and an
abstention are the same act and collapse to `model_silent`; what stays
distinguishable — and what actually matters — is that act versus every
`fail_closed_*`. Copy radius's discipline, not its exact token list.

**The single sharpest protocol finding of this programme, from VRRP.**
**CARP is byte-ambiguous with VRRPv2 and misdecodes into the most dangerous
possible message.** Its first octet is `0x21` — a valid VRRPv2 advertisement.
Its `carp_authlen` of 7 lands exactly on VRRP's count-IP-addresses octet, and
`8 + 7*4 == 36` is precisely the CARP header length, so a VRRP decoder accepts a
real CARP packet **without erroring**. Worse, `carp_advskew` of 0 lands on
VRRP's priority field — so a perfectly healthy CARP host decodes as *a master
resigning*, which is the one advertisement that provokes an immediate election.

That is why `variant` is a startup parameter and is **never sniffed**, and why
`a_carp_advertisement_misdecodes_as_a_vrrpv2_resignation` exists to pin it.
Generalise the lesson: when two protocols share a transport, check whether their
headers are *distinguishable* before writing a sniffer — and if they are not,
make the operator say which one, rather than guessing.

A real bug its own CARP e2e caught, worth knowing as a shape: `execute_action`
runs with **no server config in scope**, so it validated a CARP server's action
against the VRRP defaults and rejected `advskew` — the entire CARP path was
unreachable. Anything that validates against configuration must be given that
configuration, or it validates against the wrong thing.

### Tier 2 — IPv6

| Protocol | Feature | Module | Transport | Privilege | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| NDP | `ndp` | `ndp` | ICMPv6, raw socket | `RawSockets` | `landed` (`ad5ebe4a`) — Experimental |
| DHCPv6 | `dhcpv6` | `dhcpv6` | UDP 547 | `PrivilegedPort(547)` | `landed` (`2724244c`) — Experimental |

Both belong to the **deliberately-silent** class for the same reason as LLMNR:
an NDP or DHCPv6 answer writes a binding into the peer's stack. Fabricating one
is cache poisoning. Fail silent, log `decision=`.

**The no-storage rule has a consequence worth generalising, which DHCPv6 found
the hard way.** NetGet holds nothing between one model call and the next — so in
any multi-message exchange where the client correlates replies on a
*server-generated* identifier, that identifier must be **deterministic**, not
random. A DHCPv6 client rejects a REPLY whose Server Identifier differs from the
ADVERTISE's, and since the two come from separate model calls with no state
between them, a randomly generated default DUID would break every four-message
exchange. The default is therefore a constant DUID-EN (enterprise 32473, IANA's
reserved documentation number), asserted byte for byte. Ask the same question of
any protocol with a handshake: *what does the peer correlate on, and can we
reproduce it without remembering anything?*

Two `dhcproto` limitations it worked around, recorded so nobody re-discovers
them: `v6::duid::Duid::link_layer` takes the link-layer address as an `Ipv6Addr`
and always writes 16 octets, so it **cannot express a DUID-LL for Ethernet**
(a real one carries a 6-octet MAC) — all four DUID forms are hand-encoded
instead; and it emits the domain search list through a `trust-dns` encoder with
**name compression on**, so a second name sharing a suffix comes back as a
pointer that a client must follow.

> **Router Advertisement was not separately selected, and is nonetheless
> implemented** — RA is ICMPv6 type 134, i.e. part of NDP, so building NDP
> properly delivered it. `send_router_advertisement` carries prefixes with L/A
> flags and both lifetimes, RDNSS (RFC 8106) and MTU, which is the whole
> `mitm6`-class capability. Every RA comes from an explicit model action; there
> is deliberately **no advertisement timer**, so nothing keeps advertising after
> the model stops answering.

**How NDP answered "independent implementation, same author is weak evidence".**
Its checksum literals came from a second one's-complement implementation written
from RFC 8200 §8.1 — which is a weak claim on its own, and it said so. So
`the_checksum_is_reproducible_by_hand` works the smallest case out arithmetically
*in its doc comment* (five addends → `0x18446` → fold → `0x8447` → `0x7bb8`), and
the two terms shown are exactly the two classic mistakes: `0x003a`, the next
header that must be 58, and `0xff04`, the destination address — which is why an
ICMPv6 checksum cannot be computed from the ICMPv6 bytes alone. A reader can
check it without running anything. Copy this wherever a magic constant is the
evidence.

### Tier 3 — become an interface

| Protocol | Feature | Module | Privilege | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| TUN/TAP endpoint | `tuntap` | `tuntap` | `Root` | `landed` (`e73946b9`) — Experimental |
| Raw IP protocol-N | `rawip` | `rawip` | `RawSockets` | `landed` (`a5f40d50`) — Experimental |

**TUN/TAP is the item that changes what NetGet is** rather than adding another
protocol: it takes a real interface, and every routed IP packet becomes an
event, so any L3 service can be synthesized without implementing it.

It has one genuine design problem that must be solved before implementation,
not during: **a per-packet LLM call is hopelessly slow.** Script and static
handlers have to be the default path, with the model reserved for packets a
handler explicitly escalates. Do not ship a version that asks the model per
packet — it will look broken. `CLAUDE.md`'s note that scripts and static
handlers are "the right default for deterministic behavior" is load-bearing here.

**Raw IP protocol-N** is the generic home for protocols with no other (GRE 47,
ESP 50). Keep it genuinely generic; it must not become a per-protocol match.

**Raw IP's genericity is guarded executably, and that is the pattern to copy
whenever a rule is architectural rather than behavioural.** A comment saying "do
not branch on the protocol number" decays; `decoding_does_not_depend_on_the_protocol_number`
does not. It decodes one packet under twelve different protocol numbers and
asserts identical fields *including the payload slice*, so it fails the moment
someone adds `47 => parse_gre()`. Two numeric matches survive and are correct:
the IP **version** nibble (two header formats, not two carried protocols) and a
protocol-number→name string table, which is data rather than logic.

One honest limitation it surfaced and did not paper over: **IPv6 raw sockets do
not deliver the IP header** — the kernel strips it — so on that path the decoder
would see only the payload and drop the packet. Recorded in both its CLAUDE.md
files rather than discovered later by someone debugging live.

### Tier 4 — telecom

| Protocol | Feature | Module | Transport | Privilege | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| GTP-C / GTP-U | `gtp` | `gtp` | UDP 2123 / 2152 | **none** — both above 1024 | `landed` (`b1642019`) — Experimental |
| M3UA / SIGTRAN | `m3ua` | `m3ua` | SCTP 2905 | none (port is high) | `landed` (`55f03bb6`) — Experimental; SCTP never executed |

**GTP is the pleasant surprise of this tier**: both its ports are above 1024, so
it needs no privilege and is fully testable here. The model plays an SGW/PGW in
a mobile core. Nobody has an LLM-driven one.

**M3UA is blocked on transport, not on effort.** macOS has no SCTP stack, so its
real transport is unavailable on the machine that would test it. Three ways out,
in order of honesty:

1. Implement over SCTP, and return a clear `Err` naming the missing stack on
   platforms without it — the `bluetooth_ble_beacon` precedent. **Hiding a
   protocol is not the same as refusing to start it**: refused, the operator
   gets `ServerStatus::Error` naming the reason; hidden, nobody learns why.
2. Offer a `transport: tcp` startup parameter for lab use, marked plainly as
   **non-standard** in both the parameter description and `metadata().notes`.
   Some stacks do this; it is not the spec.
3. Userspace SCTP. `webrtc-rs` is already in the tree and carries an SCTP
   implementation, so this is not as far-fetched as it sounds — but it is a
   real project, not a side effect of this one.

Whichever is chosen, M3UA cannot be rated above `Experimental` from macOS.

**M3UA's SCTP handling is the pattern for an unavailable transport.** The
SCTP attempt is a **runtime probe, not a `cfg`**: it asks `socket2` for an
`IPPROTO_SCTP` socket and, on failure, returns an `Err` naming SCTP, RFC 4666,
the escape hatch, and the fact that the escape hatch is non-standard. Three
consequences follow, all of them wanted — the whole path compiles on macOS so it
is type-checked rather than being code nobody builds; a Linux kernel with `sctp`
unloaded is diagnosed identically to macOS; and an operator gets a sentence
rather than an errno.

Equally worth copying: **the non-standard label travels**. `"tcp (NON-STANDARD
lab transport, not SIGTRAN)"` appears in the startup-parameter description the
model reads, `metadata().notes`, the startup log, a standalone WARN, the
dashboard's `protocol_info` row, and **every event's `transport` field** — with a
test asserting each, plus that the declared default is still `"sctp"`, so a
flipped default cannot silently give an SCTP-capable host lab framing.

### Tier 5 — automotive

| Protocol | Feature | Module | Transport | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| CAN bus / SocketCAN | `can` | `can` | `AF_CAN` (Linux) | `landed` (`09b6876d`) — Experimental, Linux transport never compiled |

**Two patterns from CAN worth reusing for any platform-gated protocol.**
First, its refusal test does not stop at asserting `spawn()` returns `Err` — it
then starts the same protocol on its UDP transport on the same host, which proves
the refusal is a **routing decision rather than a dead end**. An assertion that
something fails is much weaker than one showing what still works. Second, the
refusal message is a single `const` quoted verbatim by the runtime error, the
docs and the test, so the three cannot drift.

It also *removed* a startup parameter it had planned (`fd`): `CanFdSocket` reads
both classic and FD frames off one socket, so the knob would have had nothing to
do. Declining to declare a parameter is the cheap way to avoid the
declared-but-unread trap that `startup_param_drift_test` exists to catch.

An LLM-driven ECU simulator, and a genuinely underserved niche. Linux `vcan`
needs **no hardware**, so it is trivially testable on Linux and not at all on
macOS. Same rule as M3UA: implement for Linux, return a clear `Err` naming the
platform elsewhere, and rate honestly. The `socketcan` crate must be a
target-gated optional dependency so non-Linux builds do not try to compile it.

---

## Deliberately deferred

Recorded so they are not re-litigated from scratch.

| Item | Why deferred |
|---|---|
| IPv6 Router Advertisement | Not selected in the September 2026 pass. Recommended; see the Tier 2 note. |
| Transparent intercept (`pf divert-to` / nfqueue) | Most invasive thing considered. Viable but wants its own design pass. |
| Diameter | Pairs with `radius` and works over TCP here, but was not selected. |
| 802.11 rogue AP | macOS cannot inject; needs Linux plus a specific chipset. |
| IPMI/RMCP+, WinRM, DCERPC | Session crypto and IDL marshalling; the model contributes almost nothing for thousands of lines of framing. |
| Redfish | Cheap to build, but the only real clients are Python, and `CLAUDE.md` rules that a generic HTTP client is not Beta evidence — it would be permanently `Experimental`. |

## An unused validation avenue: `tshark`

**`tshark` 4.x is installed on this machine, and it dissects most of what this
programme added.** The GTP agent used it and nobody else did: it rebuilt four of
the server's own outbound packets octet-for-octet from its test assertions,
wrapped them with `text2pcap`, and dissected them. All four parsed with **zero
expert warnings**, including a PN-set/S-clear G-PDU where Wireshark found the
inner IPv4 packet only after all four optional octets — third-party confirmation
of the E/S/PN all-or-nothing rule, from an implementation that shares no code
with ours.

This validates the **encode direction only**, which is exactly the half most of
our raw-socket protocols cannot otherwise prove. It is available today for LLDP,
CDP, STP, VRRP, NDP, DHCPv6, HSRP, WoL, EAPOL and CAN.

It was deliberately **not** wired into the suite, on the reasoning that a test
needing `tshark` would skip when absent, and a skip-when-missing gate is a silent
pass rather than evidence. That reasoning is sound but the conclusion is a
choice, not a necessity: `npm`'s test shows the third option — **hard-fail when
the binary is missing**. The real trade is whether `tshark` becomes a build
requirement wherever the suite runs, exactly as `nats-server` now is. Worth
deciding deliberately rather than by default; it would move several protocols
from "codec proven only against ourselves" to "codec proven against Wireshark".

## A new build requirement: `nats-server`

The NATS **client**'s Beta rating rests on a test that spawns the real
`nats-server` binary (v2.14.6, installed September 2026) and hard-fails when it
is absent — deliberately, because a skip-when-missing gate is a silent pass and
is not evidence. **So `nats-server` must exist wherever that suite runs.**

Today this costs nothing: `ci.yml`'s `test` job builds
`tcp,http,dns,udp,redis,mcp-stdio`, which does not include `nats`, so the test
is never compiled there. **Anyone adding `nats` to the CI feature set must also
install `nats-server` in that job**, or the build will fail — correctly, and
loudly, which is the intended behaviour.

The same will apply to any protocol promoted by the "install the real client"
route: Gopher would need `geomyidae`/`gophernicus`, Finger a real daemon, LLDP
`lldpd`. That is the price of the Beta bar, and it is the right price.

## Follow-ups this programme created

Each was found by an agent working inside its own boundary, reported rather than
reached outside to fix, and is small. Do them once the waves have landed, not
during — every one touches a shared file.

1. **`src/tui/wireshark.rs` has no entry for any protocol added here.**
   Two concrete instances confirmed by agents: DHCPv6 (`wireshark.rs:203` has
   `"dhcp" | "bootp" => udp("dhcp")` and no `dhcpv6` arm) and Wake-on-LAN.
   Both are one-line additions. That table
   maps NetGet protocol → transport + Wireshark dissector, and a protocol missing
   from it is treated as plain TCP. That is wrong for every UDP and link-layer
   protocol in this programme. Wake-on-LAN found it (it is UDP/9 with the `wol`
   dissector, not TCP); the same applies to SSDP, LLMNR, NetBIOS-NS, HSRP, GTP,
   DHCPv6, NDP, VRRP, LLDP, CDP, STP, EAPOL and CAN. Every name added must be
   checked against `tshark -d` / `-Y`, as the existing table's entries were.
2. **The privilege gate is per-protocol, not per-transport.** Confirmed
   independently by the LLDP and STP agents. `server_startup` evaluates
   `privilege_requirement` *before* reading startup parameters, so a protocol
   honestly declaring `RawSockets` is refused on an unprivileged host **even when
   asked for its UDP test transport**. The suites work around it by calling
   `Server::spawn` directly, following `bluetooth_ble_beacon`. The fix is a
   per-transport privilege query in `server_startup`; the wrong fix is declaring
   `None`, which would lie about the transport anyone actually uses.
3. **`CLAUDE.md`'s "Running tests" example is not a valid cargo invocation, and
   this file repeated it.** It shows `--test server::tcp::e2e_test`, but `--test`
   names a test *target* — a file in `tests/` — so the target is `server` and the
   rest is a filter. Cargo lists the available targets and exits rather than
   running anything, which reads like a broken suite. The working form is:

   ```bash
   ./cargo-isolated.sh test --no-default-features --features tcp \
       --test server -- server::tcp --test-threads=100
   ```

   Every agent in this programme was briefed with the wrong form and each worked
   it out independently. Fix the example in `CLAUDE.md`.
4. **`validate_static_action_names` never reads a client's async actions.**
   Found by the Ident client agent. `src/events/handler.rs` builds its catalogue
   from `get_sync_actions()` plus event-type actions only — so any client that
   follows the "clients union, don't duplicate into both methods" rule **cannot be
   routed with a static handler**, failing with *"Unknown action … Valid actions
   for X: append_memory, …"*. **`whois` has this bug today**: its own
   `get_startup_examples()` static example cannot be created. The ~40 clients that
   appear to work do so by duplicating their whole list into `get_sync_actions()`.
   The fix is a one-line change to teach the validator to read async actions for
   clients; the local workaround is to attach the vocabulary via
   `EventType::with_actions(...)`, which is what that field is for.
5. **Trim unused feature dependencies.** `stp` declares `pnet` and does not use it
   (its codec is hand-written; `pcap` covers capture and injection). Check `lldp`,
   `cdp` and `eapol` for the same once they land — I declared all four alike when
   wiring, before knowing which would need it. A declared-but-unused dependency is
   build weight and a false signal about how a protocol works.

## Working rules for this programme

Learned from the incidents recorded in `CLAUDE.md`, and applied to every wave:

1. **Wire shared files centrally, before fanning out.** `Cargo.toml`, both
   registries, `src/server/mod.rs`, `src/client/mod.rs` and both test `mod.rs`
   files are edited by one actor only. Feature gating means an agent can build
   and test its own protocol alone even though the others do not exist yet.
2. **Each agent owns exactly two directories** and commits them through a
   private index (`GIT_INDEX_FILE`) with a compare-and-swap `update-ref`. The
   shared index races; five separate incidents are on record.
3. **Stage the waves.** Do not run twenty-plus agents at once — they serialize
   on the shared `target/` build lock, and a large wave during a degraded API
   period once burned ~9.8M tokens for 5 usable results.
4. **A validation client's licence is a dev-dependency question, not a shipping
   question.** NetGet is `AGPL-3.0-or-later` (`Cargo.toml` line 5). A test-only
   client is never linked into a distributed binary, which is the same basis on
   which the MPL-2.0 `irc` and `attohttpc` test dependencies are already here.
   `async-stomp` is EUPL-1.2 and was cleared on that ground *and* because
   EUPL-1.2's compatibility appendix names AGPL-3.0 explicitly. Escalate a
   copyleft **runtime** dependency; a dev-dependency usually just needs the
   reasoning written down.

   **`LICENSE_ANALYSIS.md` contradicts itself and the manifest** and should be
   re-derived before anyone relies on it: it claims "No copyleft obligations
   (can keep code proprietary if desired)" a few lines after answering "Can
   NetGet be closed-source? **No**", and it describes a project that is not
   AGPL. Not fixed here; recorded so the next licence question starts from the
   manifest rather than from that file.
5. **Watch `df` between waves.** `target/` reached 130 GB in one session, and at
   zero bytes free the session cannot recover — every tool call needs to write.
   `cargo clean --profile dev` is the remedy and keeps `target/release`.

# Programme 2 — quality pass over every protocol

Started 4 September 2026. Goal: every one of the 154 servers and 102 clients
audited and improved for robustness, failure semantics, model-facing accuracy,
lifecycle correctness, test honesty and documentation truth.

**Paused mid-flight on quota exhaustion.** Read "Where to resume" below.

## How the work is organised

39 family batches, one agent each, run in waves of about ten. Each agent works
in **its own git worktree** with a **shared `CARGO_TARGET_DIR`**
(`/Users/matus/dev/netget-shared-target`) — worktrees give git isolation, the
shared target directory stops 39 private `target/` trees refilling the disk.

**`src/tui/wireshark.rs` is deliberately excluded from every agent's boundary.**
Agents report the correct entry for their protocols; it is applied centrally.
One table edited by 39 agents is the collision this repo has already hit.

## The eight-point rubric each agent applies

1. **Robustness** — hostile input must not panic, hang or allocate without bound:
   unbounded line/message reads, missing read timeouts, byte-index slicing on a
   `&str` (use `crate::utils::truncate_for_log`), a lock guard held across an
   `.await` doing I/O or an LLM call, `block_on`/`blocking_lock()` on the async
   runtime, and library panics reachable from the wire.
2. **Failure semantics** — a `crate::utils::wire_failure` category to the peer
   (never the error text), or deliberate silence where every reply the protocol
   defines is a positive assertion; `decision=` log tags as `src/server/radius/`.
3. **Model-facing surface** — action descriptions match executor behaviour, every
   declared `example` accepted by its own executor, no raw bytes or base64,
   `.with_actions(...)` on every event, every declared event actually emitted.
4. **Startup parameters** — declared ⇄ read both ways; `?` never `unwrap()`.
5. **Lifecycle** — `spawn()` awaits readiness and returns `Err`; every spawned
   task registered; connection stats updated; `.connectionless()` where apt.
6. **Tests** — `verify_mocks()` everywhere; wait for *conditions*, never fixed
   sleeps; an `#[ignore]`d or skip-when-missing test is not evidence.
7. **Docs and honesty** — `CLAUDE.md` matches the code; **lower** any maturity
   rating the evidence does not support and say why.
8. **Wireshark** — report the entry, do not edit the file.

**Prefer removing a defect or a lie over adding a feature.** "This one is already
sound" is a good outcome; inventing work to look productive is not. Never weaken
a test to make it pass.

## Where to resume

- **Wave 1 (pilot) was in flight when quota ran out**: `mail` (smtp/imap/pop3/nntp),
  `l2raw` (arp/datalink/icmp/igmp), `db-core` (mysql/postgresql/redis/memcached).
  Their worktrees may hold committed or partial work — **check
  `git worktree list` and each worktree's log before re-running them**, and merge
  anything already committed rather than redoing it.
- The pilot existed to validate two unknowns: the worktree mechanics (where it
  lives, what branch, how commits come back) and whether the rubric yields real
  fixes rather than busywork. **Answer those before launching the remaining 36.**
- Everything after the pilot is unstarted.

## Two operational corrections learned in wave 2

**A shared `CARGO_TARGET_DIR` corrupts binary-spawning test suites.** It was the
right call for disk (39 private target trees would refill the disk), but
`tests/examples`, `tests/terminal_snapshot` and every suite that spawns
`target/debug/netget` read a binary another agent may be rebuilding *right now*.
The DNS batch saw ten client tests fail with `Client protocol 'DNS' exists but is
not compiled into this build`; all ten passed unchanged in a private target dir.

So: **share the target dir for ordinary builds, but verify binary-spawning suites
in a private one** — `CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/tmp/verify-<batch>`. Treat any
"protocol exists but is not compiled in" failure during a wave as contention
until proven otherwise; it is an artefact, not a regression.

**A blocking `std::process::Command::output()` deadlocks the in-process mock
model.** The test's current-thread runtime is shared with the mock Ollama server,
so a blocking `dig` waits for a model that cannot run until `dig` returns. It
presents as `;; connection timed out` against a perfectly healthy server. Use the
async spawn. Related: `start_netget_server` returns when startup is *parsed*, not
when the socket is bound.

## Wave 4/5 — cut short by a second session limit, work preserved

Six agents were killed mid-task on 11 September. **Every one had committed real fixes first**,
and those were merged; each agent's final in-flight edits were preserved by the supervising
session as a `wip(...)` commit at the tip of its branch and **deliberately excluded from the
merge**. The precedent for that caution is the previous wave, whose `wip` commit contained a
helper referencing a function that existed nowhere and could never have compiled.

| batch | branch | merged | unverified WIP left on branch |
|---|---|---|---|
| core-transport | `worktree-agent-a3e18a8987266e2bc` | 4 commits | `00883c69` |
| netmgmt | `worktree-agent-a49600538a485057e` | 2 commits | `6293ce0c` |
| chat | `worktree-agent-a48f49cf447d93de7` | 1 commit | `eb6cc6bb` |
| tls-vpn | `worktree-agent-a357b18f2ed735606` | 4 commits | `dd7f5d41` |
| web-aux | `worktree-agent-a09462d7c51094ccf` | 8 commits | `7d408691` |
| auth-web | `worktree-agent-aa3a5bf60938d9bda` | **none** | `07b85160` — all its work is unverified |

**To resume**: `git merge --no-ff worktree-agent-<id>` picks up the WIP too, so verify it first.
`auth-web` should simply be re-run — it committed nothing, and it is the family containing the
OAuth2 fail-open that `CLAUDE.md` names as the worst defect in the codebase's history.

**The stack-overflow class has now been found in four protocols**: AMQP, NATS and STOMP in the
messaging family, and SNMP's BER decoder here — *"one 60 KB datagram kills the whole process"*.
It is worth checking any remaining decoder that can call itself.

Client directories whose name differs from the server's — the batch owning the
server also owns these: `bluetooth` (ble-core), `dynamodb` (db-cloud),
`openidconnect` and `saml` (auth-web), `tor` (p2p).

## Worktree mechanics — answered, no need to re-derive

Agent worktrees live at `.claude/worktrees/agent-<id>`, each on its own branch
`worktree-agent-<id>`, branched from the master commit at launch. They are
**locked**, so `git worktree prune` will not remove them. Merge with
`git merge --no-ff <branch>` from the main tree; per-protocol directories are
disjoint, so conflicts should be limited to shared files agents were told not
to touch.

Wave 1 ran until a session limit killed all three agents mid-task. **Every one
had produced real fixes first**, and the pilot therefore did its job: it proved
the rubric finds genuine defects rather than generating busywork.

| batch | branch | verified commit | unverified WIP |
|---|---|---|---|
| mail | `worktree-agent-a26377dd9a0f3624b` | `fa9f7775` — a mutex guard in a `match` scrutinee deadlocked the NNTP client read loop | `616f818d` (smtp) |
| l2raw | `worktree-agent-ae9489544f89cd1ea` | `0ce7a3bc` — ARP: a client deadlock, a discarded model answer, a leaked capture handle, and a missing fail-closed log | `4da520ba` (icmp) |
| db-core | `worktree-agent-afc24a51591969272` | `606d33a5` — MySQL prepared statements never worked: three defects and the docs that hid them | `6430977f` (postgresql) |

**The `wip(...)` commits were made by the supervising session, not by the agents,
and were never built or tested.** They exist so the work is not lost, not because
they are believed correct. Verify before merging; treat them as a starting point.

The three named fixes are the agents' own commits and were made in the normal
way, but **none has been verified by a build in the main tree** — the session
lost its quota before that could happen. Build and test each before merging.

Note the `mail` branch also merged master into itself, so a diff against the old
base shows 249 commits; only `fa9f7775` and `616f818d` are its own work.

**Agent worktrees branch from `origin/master`, NOT from local `HEAD`. Push
before launching them.** This is the most expensive thing wave 1 taught, and it
is not obvious.

Local master was 249 commits ahead of the remote when wave 1 launched, so all
three worktrees were created at `525029e1` — a base predating every one of those
commits. The `mail` agent noticed and merged master into its worktree first,
which is why it merged back cleanly. The other two did not, and re-fixed ground
master had already covered: `687c4c7a` had made every documented example
executable, and `176fafe8`/`20f36994` had already reworked ARP. Merging them back
produced semantic conflicts between two independent fixes to the same lines —
the worst kind to resolve, because both sides are *correct* and neither is
simply newer.

The rule is now in `CLAUDE.md`: **pushing to `origin` is pre-authorised in this
repo, so push as you go.** Before launching any worktree wave, verify
`git rev-list --count origin/master..HEAD` is `0`.

**What the pilot settled:** the worktree mechanics (above), and that the rubric
yields real defects — a deadlock, a discarded answer, a resource leak and a
whole broken feature, inside three families in one short wave. The remaining 36
batches can proceed on the same pattern.

Check each with `git -C .claude/worktrees/agent-<id> log --oneline` and
`git -C .claude/worktrees/agent-<id> status` before deciding — a worktree at
base may still hold uncommitted work that is worth keeping.


# Programme 3 — complete server and client protocol expansion

Requested 1 October 2026. This is the durable implementation checklist for the researched catalogue: **52 new protocol families, 15 existing-protocol completions, and 5 explicitly separated extensions mentioned in the research**. The user authorized implementation of all items using sub-agents, with the coordinator managing integration and disk use. These are useful, documented protocol scopes; a checkbox never implies implementation of every optional part of a standard.

## Completion rules

- A top-level checkbox is checked only after the stated server/client scope is implemented, registered, documented, built, and validated. A source stub, matching homemade encoder/decoder, successful handshake alone, or a skipped test is not completion.
- Record exact test commands/results, independent peer/version, implementation limitations and commit with each finished item. Runtime maturity must reflect the evidence; checklist completion does not automatically confer Stable status.
- Rust owns framing, crypto, IDs, sequencing, bounds and timers. Structured actions/events expose decisions to script/static/manual/LLM handlers. Domain data uses existing shared state facilities, with no new protocol-specific storage engines.
- Clients include command injection, event handlers, owned-task cleanup and cancellation. Servers register all tasks, expose startup parameters and release sockets/peers on stop.
- Test an independent client against the server and the client against an independent server, as well as the NetGet pair. Where independent evidence is unavailable, leave the validation checkbox open and state the precise gap.
- New features must be wired to module/registry/known-name tables and test roots, with portable build membership decided from actual dependencies. Preserve existing protocols and unrelated working-tree changes.

## Research findings that affect implementation

The research counted 169 server registration sites and 103 client registration sites, including device profiles and partial implementations. These are source counts, not runtime counts or conformance claims. At that research snapshot, HTTP/3 had a real client but no matching server; the QUIC server handled raw streams. The generic gRPC server is unary-only and does not serve reflection. SSH already contains an SFTP server but its client lacks SFTP. Existing AMQP is 0-9-1, so AMQP 1.0 is distinct. OTLP currently has an HTTP receiver.

Redfish was previously deferred on the assumption that suitable peers were Python-only. [Gofish](https://github.com/stmcginnis/gofish) supplies an independent Go client, so that rationale should not prevent implementing it. DNP3's prominent Rust library is commercial; dependency choice must be resolved before integration. Current repository pins (Hickory 0.24, russh 0.45, tonic 0.12/prost 0.13) make current-library compatibility an explicit check, not an assumption.

Priority is an engineering judgment: **A** strongest general fit, **B** useful follow-on, **C** workload-specific. Effort **S/M/L** is comparative and covers both roles, a useful documented scope and interoperability tests. API profiles such as SCIM and Redfish add schema/state semantics over HTTP. Collector/exporter and peer roles count as the two natural protocol sides where client/server is not the native terminology.

## Disk and collaboration policy

Initial free space was approximately 71 GiB. The active main checkout is heavily modified by other work. After temporary-directory cleanup, source worktrees were restored from their retained Git branches under `/Users/matus/dev/netget/.protocol-expansion-20261001/`; build artifacts share `/private/tmp/netget-protocol-target-20261002`. All programme builds now run through `python3 /Users/matus/dev/netget/.protocol-expansion-20261001/run_cargo.py ...`, which serializes them, disables debug symbols/incremental compilation and limits build jobs. New builds require 30 GiB free; the guard stops only its owned build if space drops below 25 GiB.

Do not delete unrelated worktrees, artifacts, logs, source, Cargo caches or running processes. Reclaim only verified programme-owned build artifacts between builds. The coordinator checks disk before each batch and after builds. Agents commit within their assigned branches; the coordinator merges validated batches into local `master` and pushes to `origin/master`, as explicitly authorized on 2 October 2026. GitHub PRs are not part of this workflow. No duplicate per-agent target directories or full-feature build storms.

## Active assignments and progress

- Completed: **30 / 72**; **42 remain**. Completed scopes comprise twelve new families, fourteen existing-protocol completions and four separated extensions. All remaining entries are authorized: 40 new families, the OCI client and GraphQL subscriptions.
- Integration branch: `protocol-expansion-20261001`. All completed scopes pass coordinator gates. Signed implementations and reviewed corrections merge into local master and push directly to origin/master; no GitHub PRs. The content-preserving `AGENTS.md` migration remains integrated.
- Agent `queue_continue`: Bolt61 passes final integration; OCI62 has 27 client and 21 server checks on the refreshed base, with final signed source/integration gates pending. NETCONF peer calibration and the remaining assigned service APIs follow.
- Agent `http3_continue`: Connect RPC13 passes final integration; gNMI04 Capabilities/Get/Set/subscriptions are active, followed by assigned RPC and streaming families.
- Agent `metrics_continue`: TACACS+07 and shared startup/privacy corrections pass final integration; Diameter08 has calibrated independent Python/Go peers and active native implementation, followed by assigned industrial and framed-service families.
- Three workers maximum, one guarded build at a time. Remote master advanced to `88657066`; its **21 protocol-pair jobs** and **14 general job instances** pass ([pairs](https://github.com/smotanacom/netget/actions/runs/37105040499), [general](https://github.com/smotanacom/netget/actions/runs/37105040567)). Signed merge `ed66d10f` preserves that work. Batch 10 passed the refreshed coordinator gates; its workflow requires **24 mandatory protocol-pair jobs**, whose new remote executions await publication.

## Existing protocol completion checklist

- [x] **53. HTTP/3 server**.
  - Scope: Real HTTP/3 headers/data/control/QPACK using h3/quinn and existing HTTP/3 client interoperability.
  - [x] Missing functionality implemented and registered; existing side preserved.
  - [x] Both directions validated with external peers and the NetGet pair.
  - [x] Negative/lifecycle tests, feature build, documentation and integrated commit recorded.

  - Validation: 8 server, 6 client and 2 standalone cancellation/early-hints tests passed with aioquic 1.3.0 and direct NetGet pairing at 100 threads in the final combined build. Code `168b8e82`, TE correction `c4ddd3df`, peer-port fix `73292cbc`, published master `313ad42e`. Authenticated TLS, real h3/QPACK/control, bounded UTF-8 headers/bodies/trailers and owned stream cancellation; no push, DATAGRAM/WebTransport, migration or 0-RTT. Experimental. Vendored h3-quinn 0.0.10 contains the tested pending-read cancellation fix.

- [x] **54. Raw QUIC client**.
  - Scope: Stream-oriented counterpart to existing raw QUIC server; explicit ALPN and stream lifecycle.
  - [x] Missing functionality implemented and registered; existing side preserved.
  - [x] Both directions validated with external peers and the NetGet pair.
  - [x] Negative/lifecycle tests, feature build, documentation and integrated commit recorded.
  - Validation: 6 client and 10 server tests passed with aioquic 1.3.0 in both independent roles and direct NetGet binary pairing. Code `5a872651`, allocation/pairing follow-up `7afc32e0`, final merge `b7a2e7c6`. Raw ALPN is now `netget-quic`; `h3` is reserved for HTTP/3. Verified TLS/custom trust, 1 MiB decoded/4 MiB encoded bounds, owned concurrent streams, cancellation and socket release. Experimental; no 0-RTT/datagrams/unidirectional application streams.

- [x] **55. SFTP client**.
  - Scope: Extend SSH with file/directory operations matching existing server SFTP, plus real external-server evidence.
  - [x] Missing functionality implemented and registered; existing side preserved.
  - [x] Both directions validated with external peers and the NetGet pair.
  - [x] Negative/lifecycle tests, feature build, documentation and integrated commit recorded.

  - Validation: read-only SFTP v3 stat, directory listing and UTF-8 file windows are integrated as `4a4884b0` (accurate startup modes `2e905b45`). In the merged `tcp,gearman,ssh` build, all 16 SSH client and 14 existing SSH server tests passed at 100 threads with independent OpenSSH 10.3p1 and direct NetGet pairing. All 129 shared checks across 31 targets, correctness/suspicious/unused-must-use lint and whole formatting pass. SFTP requires an explicit SHA256 host pin; bounded framing/channel queues and owned socket shutdown are tested. Experimental; no writes, binary file action, known_hosts, forwarding, second independent SFTP implementation, fuzz or new pcap claim. Logs: `.protocol-expansion-20261001/logs/batch5-ssh-initial.log` and `batch5-{shared,clippy,format}-initial.log`.


- [x] **56. OTLP client and gRPC receiver**.
  - Scope: Export traces/metrics/logs, both HTTP and gRPC as advertised; gRPC server alongside existing HTTP receiver.
  - [x] Missing functionality implemented and registered; existing side preserved.
  - [x] Both directions validated with external peers and the NetGet pair.
  - [x] Negative/lifecycle tests, feature build, documentation and integrated commit recorded.

  - Validation: 40 checks (9 client, 31 receiver) passed at 100 test threads. Official core Collector 0.162.0 independently receives typed traces, gauge metrics and text logs over HTTP protobuf and gRPC; otel-cli 0.4.5 and telemetrygen 0.161.0 exercise the receiver. Verified TLS exports/custom CA, none/gzip, partial success, retry/status details, message/body limits, deadline cancellation and same-connection recovery are covered. Existing HTTP checks remain. Code `00a32c6c`, compression/deadline-header correction `481fb76b`; shared tonic patch `c2a589a5` separately passes three 4 MiB boundary regressions and 28 gRPC/etcd neighbor checks. Experimental: documented signal subset, same-port cleartext receiver, no receiver TLS or automatic retries.

- [x] **57. Prometheus client**.
  - Scope: Scrape, negotiate and parse metrics into structured events; remote write tracked separately.
  - [x] Missing functionality implemented and registered; existing side preserved.
  - [x] Both directions validated with external peers and the NetGet pair.
  - [x] Negative/lifecycle tests, feature build, documentation and integrated commit recorded.

  - Validation: code `26854817`; all 20 client and 18 existing server checks pass at 100 threads with Prometheus/promtool 3.15.0 and prometheus-client 0.22.1, plus NetGet pairing. Text 0.0.4/OpenMetrics 1.0, negotiation, native metric families, limits, model/manual/script handlers and cancellation are covered. No remote write, PromQL, protobuf/native histograms or OpenMetrics 2.0 claim. Experimental. The Linux independent-pair job also passed.

- [x] **58. Docker client**.
  - Scope: Structured API actions paired with existing programmable Docker server.
  - [x] Missing functionality implemented and registered; existing side preserved.
  - [x] Both directions validated with external peers and the NetGet pair.
  - [x] Negative/lifecycle tests, feature build, documentation and integrated commit recorded.

  - Validation: 34 checks (16 client, 18 preserved server) passed at 100 test threads using real Docker Engine 29.7.2 and CLI 29.8.0. Native Unix socket and owned TCP relay cover eight read operations, API negotiation, filters, nullable/list/inspect shapes, bounded payloads, command injection and cancellation. Tests only read the existing daemon; they do not pull images or create resources. Code `ae95298a`, shared integration `9008eb88`. Experimental selected read-only Engine API with a 1.47 ceiling; existing mutation refusal remains, and TLS/named pipes are outside this scope.

- [x] **59. Vault client**.
  - Scope: Structured authentication/secret operations paired with existing programmable Vault server.
  - [x] Missing functionality implemented and registered; existing side preserved.
  - [x] Both directions validated with external peers and the NetGet pair.

Source `a419d0ff`, action/redaction preflight and iterative disposal `e5be0070`, shared private access-log followup `101e50d0`. The real server deadline test ran for 123.01 seconds. Experimental; existing programmable server auth refusal is preserved and unsupported API/TLS/browser surfaces are documented.

- [x] **60. Nostr client**.
  - Scope: Publish signed events, subscribe, handle relay notices/results and close subscriptions.
  - [x] Missing functionality implemented and registered; existing side preserved.
  - [x] Both directions validated with external peers and the NetGet pair.
  - [x] Negative/lifecycle tests, feature build, documentation and integrated commit recorded.
  - Selected native scope: NIP-01 signed publishing, bounded REQ/CLOSE subscriptions and optional NIP-11 information. Rust validates event IDs and BIP340 signatures; handler results are typed. WS and verified native WSS are supported; unknown publish outcome stays unknown, subscriptions remain volatile, and AUTH/COUNT/browser execution/positive WSS interoperability are excluded from this evidence.
  - Evidence: coordinator **20 client + 33 preserved relay checks** pass at 100 test threads using independent nak 0.20.7 and rust-nostr SDK 0.45.1, the NetGet pair and real OpenSSL certificate rejection. Existing relay packet-capture checks also pass. Depth/node/retained-byte preflight precedes copying, queues/tasks are bounded, and stop cancels parked handlers. Source `dd9b01a2`; feature `nostr`; reproduction and exclusions in `tests/client/nostr/AGENTS.md`.

- [x] **61. Bolt client**.
  - Scope: Negotiated Neo4j-compatible sessions, queries/results/errors against existing server and independent server.

  - Validation: **29 new client + 69 existing server checks** pass at 100 threads with official isolated Neo4j Community 5.26.31, Java21 and bundled cypher-shell 5.26.31 / Driver5.28.15. All eight CLI cases also pass with cypher-shell 2026.09.0 / Driver6.2.1. Selected direct Bolt5.x negotiation/authentication, parameterized RUN/PULL/DISCARD, explicit transactions, RESET, typed primitive/graph/temporal/spatial results, unknown-outcome errors, bounded tasks/queues and cancellation are implemented. Native client TLS verifies WebPKI/name; untrusted-certificate rejection is tested, with no positive trusted-local TLS claim. Routing pools, Bolt6/manifest negotiation, typed complex inputs, replay, local graph/query stores and pcap/fuzz/conformance are excluded; client remains Experimental. Server arity/outbound pre-clone bounds `4ec0de1e`, native CLI compatibility `995ff86f`, client `916f63f9`, refreshed `1f0e484b`, mandatory peer CI `bdec771e`; reproduction in `tests/client/bolt/AGENTS.md`.

Nested/recursive/expanding YAML rejected before traversal.

- [x] **64. NSQ client**.
  - Scope: Publish/subscribe, negotiated readiness, acknowledgments, requeue and heartbeat.
  - [x] Missing functionality implemented and registered; existing side preserved.
  - [x] Both directions validated with external peers and the NetGet pair.
  - [x] Negative/lifecycle tests, feature build, documentation and integrated commit recorded.

Code `9758dc00`, close-order fix `5002305d`, heartbeat test correction `7a981923`, published master `313ad42e`. PUB/MPUB/DPUB, subscription/RDY, heartbeat, FIN/REQ/TOUCH and graceful CLS correlation; no lookupd discovery, TLS/auth, compression, reconnect or binary outbound body claim. Experimental.

- [x] **65. Gearman client**.
  - Scope: Job submission and selected worker exchanges with correlation and errors.
  - [x] Missing functionality implemented and registered; existing side preserved.
  - [x] Both directions validated with external peers and the NetGet pair.
  - [x] Negative/lifecycle tests, feature build, documentation and integrated commit recorded.

  - Validation: code `2a095a08`, compatible-peer corrections `f41cad44` and `7b39c75e`; all 19 client and 28 existing server checks pass at 100 threads with official gearmand/gearman/gearadmin 2.1.0. Submitter plus selected worker exchanges, correlation, exceptional outcomes, bounds, handlers and cancellation are covered. Existing server remains the documented model-as-worker role; no generic queue broker/storage claim. Experimental. Linux peer compilation is verified; the required existing packet-capture oracle exposed a missing tshark package, now added to CI and awaiting a rerun.

- [x] **66. Gemini client**.
  - Scope: TLS requests, certificate policy, status/meta/body handling and bounds.
  - [x] Missing functionality implemented and registered; existing side preserved.
  - [x] Both directions validated with external peers and the NetGet pair.
  - [x] Negative/lifecycle tests, feature build, documentation and integrated commit recorded.

  - Validation: 8 client and 25 existing server tests passed with independent dictd, dictfmt and dict 1.13.3, including the NetGet pair. Code `434fc816`, merge `9146ee6d`. Experimental client; discovery/definitions/matches, bounded multiline decoding and cancellation. No AUTH, SASL, MIME negotiation or pipelining in the new client.

## Separated extension checklist

- [x] **68. Generic gRPC streaming and reflection**.
  - Scope: Add real streaming lifecycle and reflection; support new subscription-oriented services without false capability claims.
  - [x] Implementation and all required server/client integration complete.
  - [x] Independent validation, feature build, documentation and integrated commit recorded.

  - Validation: **38 checks** (24 server, 14 client) passed at 100 threads with mandatory generated grpcio 1.75.1 peers, grpcurl 1.9.4 and NetGet pairing; seven shared converter and three tonic framing checks also pass. All stream forms, half-close, reflection v1/v1alpha and discovery, gzip/message/schema bounds, verified client TLS, owned tasks, cancellation and stalled flow control are covered. Source `92504dc9`, integration `d4e7c192`. Experimental; new streams exclude reachable bytes/binary metadata, and receiver TLS, retries, full descriptor catalogs, fuzz and pcap are not claimed.

- [x] **69. gRPC-Web binding**.
  - Scope: Implement a separately advertised client/server binding with framing, trailers and chosen streaming support.
  - [x] Implementation and all required server/client integration complete.
  - [x] Independent validation, feature build, documentation and integrated commit recorded.
  - Selected native scope: binary protobuf cleartext HTTP/1.1 unary and server streaming with bounded frames, gzip, final status envelopes, metadata and exact-origin CORS. Shared gRPC descriptors/codecs retain typed semantics. Text/JSON message modes, client/bidi streaming, reflection, TLS/browser execution and pcap/fuzz claims are excluded; state is Experimental.
  - Evidence: coordinator **11 server + nine client checks**, **38 native gRPC neighbors** and **18 wire/converter/tonic checks** pass with independent Connect-ES 2.2.0 / protobuf-es 2.16.0 Node/Fetch transports. Admission, activity and timer guards survive the last status frame through explicit body EOF, error or drop; no TCP-flush ownership is claimed. Sources `4f9bf6c7`, `f5b859a8`, metadata correction `cb46779c`; feature `grpc-web`; reproduction in `tests/server/grpc_web/AGENTS.md` and `tests/client/grpc_web/AGENTS.md`.

  - [x] Implementation and all required server/client integration complete.
  - [x] Independent validation, feature build, documentation and integrated commit recorded.
  - Selected scope: published remote-write 1.0 float samples over HTTP/1.1 protobuf and Snappy block compression, signed millisecond timestamps and finite/special/stale values. Sender retries transport/5xx failures with bounded backoff while connected; 429 retry is opt-in. Receiver decisions are typed and use shared state only. No remote-write 2.0, metadata, histograms, exemplars, TLS, durable sender queue or full conformance claim; state is Experimental.
  - Evidence: coordinator **15 receiver + nine sender checks** pass at 100 threads with official Prometheus 3.15.0 sender and TSDB receiver/readback plus the pinned official Python prometheus-client 0.22.1 scrape fixture (the daemon owns remote-write encoding).

Count tracks all records and sequence tracks export packets; source IP + SourceID owns the bounded transactional template cache. TTL/idle expiry and template refresh run in owned tasks. No IPFIX conflation, UDP acknowledgement, persistent flow store, enterprise/variable fields or full standard/pcap/fuzz claim; state is Experimental.
  - Evidence: coordinator **23 collector + seven exporter checks** pass at 100 threads with unmodified softflowd 1.1.1 in its upstream legacy build profile and official GoFlow2 2.2.7, including literal wire fixtures and the NetGet pair. Cache/count/sequence/padding/malformed input, typed scope handling, expiry/refresh and cancellation pass. Local send never claims remote collection. Source `6c83cd96`; feature `netflow-v9`; pinned bootstrap and reproduction in `tests/server/netflow_v9/AGENTS.md` and `tests/client/netflow_v9/AGENTS.md`.

- [ ] **72. GraphQL subscriptions**.

## Integrated validation evidence

- **Batch 4 — 25 Fluent Forward, 26 GELF, 53 HTTP/3 server/client, 64 NSQ client:** published master merge `313ad42e` preserves the separate codebase audit `314c819a`. Final evidence totals **213 protocol test executions**: GELF 22, NSQ 55, HTTP/3 16 including cancellation/early-hints, Forward 24, NUT 20, DoQ 18, raw QUIC 17 and Beanstalkd 41. Initial combined runs passed; after the TE and peer-port corrections, all 16 HTTP/3 and 17 raw-QUIC checks passed again at 100 test threads. No failed or ignored cases in those final runs.
- Commands: `python3 /Users/matus/dev/netget/.protocol-expansion-20261001/run_cargo.py test --locked --offline --no-default-features --features tcp,nut,doq,gelf,beanstalkd,nsq,http3,quic,fluent-forward --test server --test client -- PROTOCOL:: --test-threads=4` for each named protocol. HTTP/3 final run additionally selects `--test http3_cancellation_test` with filter `http3` and `--test-threads=100`; raw QUIC reruns use `quic::` at 100 threads. Peer environments are specified in each protocol's test documentation and persistent `validate_batch4.py`.
- **Batch 5 — 55 SFTP, 65 Gearman, 28 InfluxDB writes, 57 Prometheus client:** all **143 protocol checks** pass at 100 test threads, zero failed/ignored. Gearman 47 and SSH/SFTP 30 were run with `tcp,gearman,ssh`; InfluxDB 28 and Prometheus 38 were run with `tcp,gearman,ssh,influxdb,prometheus`. Commands use the serialized guard: `test --locked --offline --no-default-features --features FEATURES --test server --test client -- PROTOCOL:: --test-threads=100`. Both shared feature combinations pass **129 checks across 31 targets**, correctness/suspicious/unused-must-use clippy and whole-package formatting. Persistent logs are `logs/batch5-*-initial.log` and `logs/batch5-*-collectors.log` under the owned programme source root. [Linux SFTP, InfluxDB and Prometheus jobs passed](https://github.com/smotanacom/netget/actions/runs/37082508077). Gearman compiled its pinned peer, then its existing packet oracle failed for missing tshark; the CI dependency fix is included. No green full-CI claim.

- Batch 4 shared checks: **130 checks across 31 targets** pass after two targeted source-check corrections. The clean published baseline reproduced the unclassified HTTP URL validator; its deliberate rejection is recorded without rewriting requested URLs. The obsolete three-sleep HTTP/3 baseline was removed. Combined correctness/suspicious/unused-must-use lint, workflow YAML/shell syntax, test discovery and guarded whole-package formatting pass. All Cargo commands use the serialized disk guard. Logs: `/Users/matus/dev/netget/.protocol-expansion-20261001/logs/batch4-*.log`.
- The final HTTP/3 rerun exposed a fixture port reservation race before peer startup. `73292cbc` makes aioquic bind port zero itself and report its actual live socket; both affected suites pass at high concurrency. h3-quinn's pending-read cancellation panic is independently reproduced and corrected in the vendored adapter. The blocking pair workflow now includes HTTP/3, Forward, GELF and NSQ. [All six independent-pair jobs passed on Linux](https://github.com/smotanacom/netget/actions/runs/37079410969). General CI on the checklist publication is still running; no full-CI green claim.


- Remote validation of `cf3f6a74`: [protocol pair run](https://github.com/smotanacom/netget/actions/runs/37015942511) passed NUT/DoQ/StatsD and Graphite, then failed Beanstalkd 1.12 interoperability. [General CI](https://github.com/smotanacom/netget/actions/runs/37015942450) found decision-tag, private-test discovery, peer-workflow evidence, silent failure declarations and Graphite validator declaration gaps. All four single-feature shards, browser build and blocking lint passed. Corrections are merged or in local verification; no claim of a green full CI run.

- Recovery on 2 October: temporary sources, logs and artifacts had been removed; committed implementations were restored from Git. Historical test counts below were recorded before cleanup. Original temporary log paths are no longer available. Previously uncommitted HTTP/3, GELF and NSQ work was reconstructed and signed; their final integration evidence is tracked below. Free space at recovery: approximately 148 GiB.

- **Batch 3 — 54 raw QUIC completion, 66 Gemini client:** all 48 protocol tests (16 QUIC, 32 Gemini) and 71 shared checks passed at merge `b7a2e7c6` with `tcp,nut,doq,statsd,graphite,beanstalkd,dict,quic,gemini`. Same test command shape and shared targets as Batch 2; logs in `/private/tmp/netget-protocol-expansion-20261001/validation-third/`. No failed or ignored cases. Raw QUIC review is closed; the independent peers and direct NetGet pairing agree. CI's `stream-pairs` job now includes Gemini/Agate/ignition and tshark.

- **Batch 2 — 24 Graphite, 63 Beanstalkd client, 67 DICT client; raw QUIC review in progress:** all 157 protocol tests passed with `tcp,nut,doq,statsd,graphite,beanstalkd,dict,quic` together at merge `08584d20`. This includes the first three protocols after the shared task-registration fix and 14 raw QUIC tests; its direct NetGet pairing review remains open. No failed or ignored tests in the final protocol runs.
- Batch 2 commands use the Batch 1 protocol command with that expanded feature set and each of `graphite`, `beanstalkd`, `dict`, `quic`, `nut`, `statsd`, `doq`. All 71 shared checks passed, adding `task_registration_cancellation_test`, `server_task_registry_test` and `client_stop_releases_socket_test` to Batch 1's targets. An obsolete QUIC server-only pairing assertion was updated to require the implemented client, then the shared checks passed.
- Lifecycle fix `7916e859`: a started child is owned before the registration future is first polled, and cancelled if registration is dropped. Both regression tests failed before the fix; successful registration/owner removal also remain covered.
- Batch 2 logs: `/private/tmp/netget-protocol-expansion-20261001/validation-second/`. CI's separate `stream-pairs` job installs Graphite, queue, dictionary and aioquic peers. The first remote run reproduced Beanstalkd 1.12 legacy statistics incompatibility; a focused correction is being validated. The eight-scope batch was merged to master and pushed as `cf3f6a74`.

- **Batch 1 — 01 DoQ, 06 NUT, 23 StatsD/DogStatsD:** all 53 protocol tests and 62 shared checks passed with `tcp,nut,doq,statsd` enabled together at merge `07339b83`; no ignored tests in this combined run. All three remain Experimental, with their selected scope and missing maturity evidence documented in their source/test `CLAUDE.md` files.
- Protocol command, once for each `PROTOCOL` in `nut`, `statsd`, `doq`: `cargo test --locked --offline --no-default-features --features tcp,nut,doq,statsd --test server --test client -- PROTOCOL:: --test-threads=4`. The programme runs Cargo through its serialized guard and provides the documented local peer paths.
- Shared checks: `event_action_declarations_test`, `advertised_actions_test`, `well_known_port_declaration_test`, `startup_param_defaults_test`, `startup_param_drift_test`, `protocol_startup_examples_test`, `dual_protocol_test`, `dashboard_wireshark_test`, `client_event_wiring_test`, `event_emit_sites_test` with the same feature set.
- Reproduction: `.github/workflows/protocol-pairs.yml` installs independent peers and runs these suites; each protocol's test documentation describes local setup. CI YAML and peer bootstrap were validated locally; the first remote NUT/DoQ/StatsD interoperability job passed on Linux. The eight-scope batch is published on master as `cf3f6a74`. Local detailed logs are in `/private/tmp/netget-protocol-expansion-20261001/validation/`.

- Documentation migration compatibility: both path and test-count checks discover `AGENTS.md` and legacy `CLAUDE.md`. Existing legacy citations resolve only when the migrated file actually exists; missing paths and stale foreign-path exemptions still fail. All four focused tests pass, including two new migration regressions. Workflow YAML and all 90 shell steps parse successfully.

- **Batch 6 — 27 Loki, 56 OTLP completion, 58 Docker client:** the merged `tcp,docker,loki,otlp,grpc,quic,gearman,http` build passes 104 new-scope checks (30 Loki, 40 OTLP, 34 Docker), plus 47 Gearman, 17 QUIC, five HTTP transport and three tonic boundary checks: **176 total**, zero failed/ignored in the final protocol runs. Command: `python3 /Users/matus/dev/netget/.protocol-expansion-20261001/run_cargo.py test --locked --offline --no-default-features --features tcp,docker,loki,otlp,grpc,quic,gearman,http --test server --test client -- PROTOCOL:: --test-threads=100`; the HTTP fixture uses `http::transport`, and the tonic boundary target is `vendored_tonic_patch_test`. Local peer environment is documented in each test directory and the owned batch scripts.
- All **132 shared checks across 31 targets** are green after 13 focused rerun checks corrected three initial audit failures: missing OTLP canonical catalogue membership, Loki's literal tenant default and two intentional control-rejection validators. The initial failure log is retained. `clippy --lib --bin netget` with correctness/suspicious/unused-must-use denied and whole-package formatting pass. Coordinator fixes `9008eb88`, CI gates `980e24c3`.
- Concrete CI fixture corrections: `29f76b09` streams the 8 MiB-plus-one HTTP response from an owned, bounded test peer instead of exceeding the shared static-action budget; `4735e4c0` owns concurrent QUIC streams and deliberately tests six-second model replies within the existing server deadline; `276d24e8` adds Gearman's GNU argument delimiter. Runtime limits remain intact. Previous Linux run `37084245867` passed eight pair jobs but failed the old Gearman/QUIC fixtures; general run `37084245909` passed its other blocking jobs but failed the old HTTP fixture. The corrected protocol-pair run `37089027868` passed all thirteen jobs. General run `37089027861` passed its other jobs but exposed the missing DoQ size declaration corrected in batch 7; full CI is not claimed green.
- Three new blocking jobs require independent Docker, Loki/Alloy and OTLP Collector/exporter peers. Workflow YAML and **101 shell steps** parse; the Linux Collector installer syntax and official release SHA256 match are verified (actual Linux bootstrap awaits CI). The OTLP Wireshark display filter parses; this is syntax evidence, not packet-capture maturity evidence. Logs: `.protocol-expansion-20261001/logs/batch6-*` and `tonic-*`. Free space after final validation is approximately 31 GiB; owned package cleanup previously reclaimed 10.6 GiB while retaining dependency caches, sources, peers and unrelated work.

- **Batch 7 — 29 IPFIX and shared credential diagnostics:** the merged `tcp,ipfix,grpc,etcd` build passes **28 IPFIX checks** (20 collector, eight exporter), **16 gRPC and 12 etcd neighbor checks**, and **104 credential/model/logging/scripting checks across 15 targets** at 100 test threads; zero failed/ignored. Native IPFIX UDP templates/options/data cover the documented typed 35-element IANA subset, bounded transactional caches, sequences/expiry, owned queue/task cancellation and local-send honesty. Unmodified Python ipfix 0.9.7 and the actual official GoFlow2 2.2.7 service validate both roles. It remains Experimental, with no complete RFC, reliable-delivery, TLS, flow-store, fuzz or pcap claim. Source `69eb9b8c`, readable loops `427a40d4`, terminal decisions `b90022ee`.
- All **134 shared checks across 32 targets** pass after **14 focused rerun checks** corrected the initial IPFIX decision-log/declaration gaps and rechecked the updated documentation. Initial three failures in two targets remain recorded. Required lib/bin clippy gates pass with `tcp,ipfix,grpc,etcd,doq`, including compilation of the corrected DoQ frame-size metadata; whole-package formatting passes. Shared privacy `20c60670` was merged while preserving request-owned breaker permits, bounded owned resident stderr and hyphen-sensitive key redaction. Actual action/wire values and explicit display actions remain unchanged; incidental credential-bearing model/script diagnostics are suppressed per invocation.
- Blocking CI `562bad0e` adds the IPFIX pair, its single-feature check, credential regressions and the inbound-size source ratchet. Both workflow files and **105 shell steps** parse. Official GoFlow2 release metadata confirms the pinned Linux/macOS asset hashes; local required peers pass, while the new Linux job awaits publication/run. IPFIX uses UDP/cflow capture guidance; tshark accepts decode-as/display syntax, which is not packet-capture maturity evidence. Reproduction uses the shared guard with the stated feature set and `--test server --test client -- ipfix:: --test-threads=100`, with peer bootstrap/environment documented under `tests/server/ipfix` and `tests/client/ipfix`. Logs: `.protocol-expansion-20261001/logs/batch7-*` and `agent-ipfix-decisions-*`.
- Disk maintenance reclaimed Cargo-reported **4.4 GiB of owned package outputs and 6.4 GiB of remaining compiled target outputs**, under the shared lock after package-only cleanup did not restore the 30 GiB start floor. Cargo download caches/registries, source, peers, logs, unrelated targets and processes were retained. Larger observed volume changes were not attributed to this cleanup. The final guarded format run started with approximately **33 GiB free**; all subsequent builds keep the same 30/25 GiB floor/stop policy.

- **Batch 8 — 30 sFlow, 59 Vault client and 68 generic gRPC streaming/reflection:** final independent protocol coverage is **99 checks**: sFlow 27, Vault 34 and gRPC 38; **105 privacy checks across 15 targets**, **12 etcd neighbor checks** and **ten converter/tonic checks** also pass. The initial shared run passed 140 of 141 checks across 33 targets; Vault correction `e5be0070` fixes the sole recursion-audit failure. All **141 final shared checks** pass, with **24 focused checks across five targets** rerun after that correction. Zero final failures or ignores. Required lib/bin clippy gates and whole-package formatting pass with `tcp,grpc,etcd,vault,sflow`; 93 advisory clippy warnings remain. Vault exact depth 32/+1, node 65536/+1, retained-content 8 MiB/+1 and 10000-level owned/injected values are verified before copying and during safe disposal.
- Shared followup `101e50d0` records only validated offered action names for credential-bearing client action diagnostics. Peer-control correction `5c1fb583` gives GELF/Graphite/Forward/NUT honest exchange-only reasons, reads sibling action metadata, recognizes both Hyper imports and shrinks the stale gRPC exemption after real stream controls adopted a handle. Capture/golden/silence integration `e384bf5a` includes sFlow and Vault. CI `cd924b23` adds three mandatory Linux peer jobs; both workflows and **116 shell steps** parse. The pinned Vault Linux release digest and 175150654-byte archive size were verified from official release metadata. The new Linux executions await publication.
- Reproduce through the shared guard with the stated feature set, `--test server --test client -- <grpc|vault|sflow>:: --test-threads=100`. Peer installation/environment and exact selected scopes live in the corresponding server/client test documents. Logs are retained under `.protocol-expansion-20261001/logs/batch8-*`, `item68-grpc-*` and `agent-*`. Initial source failure, the agent fixture-construction stack abort and one manager validation compile started before a module conflict was resolved are retained; that premature attempt ran no tests. Subsequent clean merged runs pass.
- Package-only maintenance under the shared lock removed a Cargo-reported **4.5 GiB** of programme-owned compiled outputs, leaving approximately **34 GiB free at that point**. Dependencies/download caches, source, peer fixtures, logs, unrelated targets and processes were retained. The final guarded format check started with **30.8 GiB free**; the same 30/25 GiB start/stop policy remains in force. Other observed volume changes were not attributed to this cleanup.

- **Batch 9 — 60 Nostr client, 69 gRPC-Web, 70 remote write and 71 native NetFlow v9:** coordinator evidence totals **183 protocol/neighbor checks**: remote write24, Nostr53, gRPC-Web20, native gRPC38 and wire/value/tonic18. All final results have zero failures or ignores. The initial shared run passed142 of145 checks across34 targets and exposed three gRPC-Web integration omissions; `cb46779c` corrects the named default timeout, truthful HTTP-carrier/no-port declaration and the documented intentional unread-response wait. The complete corrected run passes **145 shared checks across34 targets**. The HTTP-only example target is inactive in this feature bundle; no executed example test is claimed for that target.
- Final **all-target** clippy correctness/suspicious/unused-must-use gates and whole-package formatting pass with `tcp,prometheus-remote-write,vault,grpc,grpc-web,nostr,netflow-v9`; advisory warnings remain. Module reachability finds **2565 reachable source/test files, zero allowlisted**, all formatted. Both workflow files, **133 shell steps** and two native peer bootstrap ASTs parse. Required independent peer downloads are versioned, bounded and hash-verified; Linux executions await the next publication run. Capture carrier mappings and aliases are checked for HTTP/cflow; this mapping is not new protocol packet-capture maturity evidence.
- Reproduce using the shared guard and this feature bundle with `--test server --test client -- <grpc_web|grpc|nostr|netflow_v9>:: --test-threads=100`, the three gRPC wire/value/tonic targets and the34 shared targets recorded in owned logs. Remote write24 was validated first with `tcp,prometheus-remote-write,vault,grpc`; unchanged source retains that evidence. Peer environments are recorded in each protocol test document. Logs: `.protocol-expansion-20261001/logs/batch9-*`, `item69-*` and `agent-*`; initial source failures and invalid post-EOS stress attempts remain recorded separately from successful runs. The corrected report index was rebuilt from retained logs after a follow-up script overwrote its index; underlying logs were retained.
- Owned package-only maintenance under the shared lock reclaimed a Cargo-reported **2.0 GiB**, then **1.9 GiB** in separate measured cleanups. Download/dependency caches, peers, sources, logs, unrelated artifacts and processes were retained. Free space after final gates is approximately **40 GiB**. All builds retain the same30 GiB start floor and25 GiB stop reserve; observed unrelated volume changes are not attributed to cleanup.

- **Batch 10 — 07 TACACS+, 13 Connect RPC and 61 Bolt client:** final root evidence totals **206 protocol/neighbor checks**: Connect22, gRPC-Web20, native gRPC38, TACACS28 and Bolt98, all at 100 test threads. A separate **26 framing/converter/tonic checks** pass. All final results have zero failed or ignored cases. Independent peer versions, selected scopes and separate signed source changes are recorded on each item; all three new scopes remain Experimental.
- Final shared/privacy/startup controls additionally enable HTTP: **149 shared checks across35 active targets**, **148 privacy checks across20 active targets** and **45 startup/management checks across8 active targets** pass. These lists overlap; counts describe executions, not distinct tests. This activates the real HTTP-gated management/followup controls rather than counting cfg-disabled targets. Shared fixes `201c2a82`, `46d9dc11` and `495bb4e1` preflight constructed JSON before copies/drop and keep credential-bearing model/script diagnostics private while preserving typed values and the numeric retryable overload category.
- Initial integration failures are retained: omitted TACACS canonical names, Connect's incorrect compiled-out feature slug, a backpressure test that did not explicitly constrain peer buffering, invisible TACACS runtime event selection and Bolt's CI filter-list shape. Corrections add the actual Cargo-feature contract, move the same reply mapping beside its runtime caller and require nonzero unignored peer test counts in the three new jobs. Both HTTP bindings verify a successful multi-megabyte wire prefix and a constrained peer receive window before leaving output unread; the one-second RPC and actual 30/120-second connection limits remain intact. Full Connect and Web suites, including all long timer cases, pass after correction.
- Final all-target correctness/suspicious/unused-must-use clippy and whole-package formatting pass with `tcp,http,connect_rpc,grpc-web,tacacs,bolt`; advisory warnings remain. Module discovery finds **2603 reachable source/test files, zero allowlisted**, all formatted. Workflow validation parses24 mandatory jobs and91 shell run steps (192 total action/setup/run steps), plus the Neo4j bash/embedded-Python and TACACS installer syntax. New Linux peer jobs await publication; the earlier published21/21 and13/13 CI results apply to5192c107.
- Reproduction: `python3 /Users/matus/dev/netget/.protocol-expansion-20261001/run_cargo.py test --locked --offline --no-default-features --features tcp,connect_rpc,grpc-web,tacacs,bolt --test server --test client --no-fail-fast -- PROTOCOL:: --test-threads=100`, once per `connect_rpc`, `grpc_web`, `grpc`, `tacacs`, `bolt`, with owned native peer environments from `validate_batch10.py` and each test document. Shared/privacy/startup/lint runs use the additional `http` feature. Exact commands, versions and final log selection are retained in `logs/batch10-final-verified-results.json`; initial and diagnostic logs remain separate. Free space after final gates is approximately35GiB, with the unchanged30/25GiB build guard and one compiled target. No unrelated artifacts or processes were removed.

- **Batch 10 refresh against current master:** preserved published `88657066` in signed merge `ed66d10f`, including prompt/browser/final-action behavior, shared privacy fixtures and FTP/Bitcoin registry regressions. Complete independent role gates still pass **206 checks**, plus **26 framing/converter checks** and **19 bridge/prompt checks**. The newly required declaration audit exposed **147 repeated findings** in new action/event lists; signed correction `55f48f44` supplies explanatory Connect/TACACS/Bolt descriptions, canonical boolean hints and safe operation-specific logs. Its mandatory CI jobs now run the upstream declaration, startup-example and executable-example gates. The audit and baseline remain unchanged.
- The complete corrected refresh passes **188 shared checks across38 targets**, **148 privacy checks across20 targets** and **45 startup/management checks across8 targets**, with zero failures. One existing shared-audit diagnostic is intentionally ignored because it measures stale baseline entries only with `all-protocols`; protocol, framing, privacy, startup and bridge/prompt tests have zero ignores. These overlapping lists count executions. All-target correctness/suspicious/unused-must-use clippy and whole-package formatting pass. Module discovery finds **2604 reachable files, zero allowlisted**, all formatted; the24 mandatory jobs,91 shell run steps and192 total steps parse. Exact final commands/logs are retained in `logs/batch10-master-refresh-final-verified-results.json`; initial audit failure evidence remains separate. The pre-Programme3 prefix retains upstream's one-line STOMP citation repair to `AGENTS.md`, rather than discarding it. Approximately33GiB remains free; the30/25GiB guard and owned shared target remain in force.

## Implementation and independent peer plan

1. NUT: start with discovery/variables and supported authenticated operations. Test server with [upsc](https://networkupstools.org/docs/man/upsc.html), client with [upsd](https://networkupstools.org/docs/man/upsd.html) using synthetic UPS data.
2. DoQ: reuse DNS codec and quinn; test against [kdig](https://www.knot-dns.cz/docs/latest/html/man_kdig.html) and [AdGuard dnsproxy](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/dnsproxy).
3. StatsD/DogStatsD: typed parsing/emission and bounded batches; avoid an LLM invocation for every metric.
4. Socket.IO: evaluate [socketioxide](https://github.com/totodore/socketioxide) and [rust_socketio](https://github.com/1c3t3a/rust-socketio), test both sides against official JavaScript implementations.
5. GraphQL: evaluate [async-graphql dynamic schemas](https://github.com/async-graphql/async-graphql); let the library enforce execution while handlers supply data, with batching at the operation boundary.
6. NETCONF: SSH/XML layers and declared capabilities; [Netopeer2](https://github.com/CESNET/netopeer2) provides independent peers.
7. gNMI: use [official protobuf definitions](https://github.com/openconfig/gnmi/blob/master/proto/gnmi/gnmi.proto) and [gNMIc](https://github.com/openconfig/gnmic); streaming cannot reuse the unary-only generic server unchanged.
8. Redfish: DMTF schemas plus Gofish for server validation and [DMTF mockup server](https://github.com/DMTF/Redfish-Mockup-Server) for read-oriented client validation.
9. ACME: evaluate [instant-acme](https://github.com/djc/instant-acme) for the client and [Pebble](https://github.com/letsencrypt/pebble) as an external server.
10. AMQP 1.0: evaluate [fe2o3-amqp](https://github.com/minghuaw/fe2o3-amqp), which has acceptor support as well as client roles.
11. OPC UA: evaluate async-opcua but validate with an independent stack. BACnet and IEC104 have independent reference tools linked above. LwM2M has [Eclipse Leshan](https://github.com/eclipse-leshan/leshan).

Suggested scheduling order: bounded NUT/DoQ/StatsD work first; application Socket.IO/GraphQL and HTTP/3/SFTP/OTLP completion next; infrastructure NETCONF/gNMI/Redfish; then remaining messaging, identity, industrial and specialist families. All checklist entries remain in the authorized scope, regardless of research priority.
