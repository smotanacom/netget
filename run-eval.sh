# run-eval.sh — the real-model eval harness.
#
# Every other test in this repository drives a MOCK model whose answers the test
# author wrote. This one drives a REAL local model, with a REAL third-party
# client (dig, curl, redis-cli, psql, ldapsearch, ipptool, whois, ftp), and
# scores whether the model could serve a plain-English operator instruction.
#
# It costs real model time and it is NOT deterministic. It must never gate a PR.
# See tests/eval/mod.rs for the design and EVAL_RESULTS.md for the output.
#
# Usage:
#   ./run-eval.sh                       # every protocol in the default set
#   ./run-eval.sh http dns tcp          # just these
#   ./run-eval.sh --runs 5 http         # 5 runs per instruction
#   ./run-eval.sh --model llama3.1:8b   # pick the model explicitly
#   ./run-eval.sh --list                # what would run, and with what client
#
# Output: eval-results/latest.json and EVAL_RESULTS.md, regenerated together.

# The default model. Chosen deliberately, and the reasoning matters:
#
#  * It is the smallest and fastest model on this machine (~12s per answer
#    against ~20s for qwen3.8:27b and ~30s for gemma4:31b), and this harness
#    makes hundreds of calls per run.
#  * A weak-but-competent model is the right instrument. A strong model papers
#    over a misleading action description by guessing what was meant; the whole
#    point here is to find descriptions that do not carry a model on their own.
#
# Override with --model or NETGET_LLM_TEST_MODEL. The model is recorded in every
# artefact, because a score is only comparable within one model.

# A LITERAL IP, not `localhost`, and this is load-bearing rather than tidiness.

# GaiResolver does not special-case a dotted quad, so on macOS `localhost` goes
# through mDNSResponder — one system-wide daemon that serialises under
# concurrency. `ollama_client::client_for_endpoint` bypasses the resolver only
# when the host parses as an IpAddr. With `localhost`, five of eleven cases in
# the first smoke run failed as "Ollama not reachable" against an Ollama that was
# up and answering; with 127.0.0.1 the bypass engages and they do not.
